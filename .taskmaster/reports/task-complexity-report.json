			"taskId": 26,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Storage Utilities",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down storage utilities into: 1) Core CRUD functions for each data type, 2) Error handling and quota management, 3) ID generation and validation logic, 4) Recipe deduplication algorithm with hashing.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity due to multiple data types, localStorage quota handling (QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR), JSON validation, crypto.randomUUID() integration, and deduplication logic using Map. Requires careful error boundaries and follows existing patterns but involves algorithmic work for hashing."

			"taskId": 27,
			"taskTitle": "Add Generate Week Button to ChatWidget",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity: simple UI button addition with styling, disable/loading states, custom event dispatch, and router navigation using existing Slice 1 router. No new logic or state management required."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 28,
			"taskTitle": "Create GenerationStatusPage Component",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) SSE connection and event handling with AbortController, 2) UI state management and progress bar animations, 3) Auto-navigation, retry logic, and cleanup.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high complexity from SSE streaming, real-time state updates, AbortController cleanup, CSS animations, event parsing ('progress', 'error', 'complete'), and conditional UI rendering. Reuses Slice 1 patterns but requires robust async handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 29,
			"taskTitle": "Implement /api/generate-meal-plan Endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) Input validation with Zod, 2) Anthropic SDK streaming setup with system prompt, 3) SSE response streaming and JSON chunk parsing, 4) Progress event simulation (10,25,50,75,90,100), 5) Timeout handling and error cases.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity: Edge runtime specifics, Anthropic SDK v1 streaming, JSON schema enforcement, real-time SSE with progress simulation, Zod validation, 60s timeout, and fallback eaters logic. Streaming parsing adds significant error-prone async complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 30,
			"taskTitle": "Create Meal Plan Transformer Utility",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Recipe extraction and deduplication by name+ingredients hash, 2) Meal creation with recipe ID references and servings calculation, 3) MealPlan assembly with weekOf/budget and Zod validation.",
			"reasoning": "Medium-high due to multi-step transformation: deduplication Map logic, UUID assignment, servings math from eaters, budget summation, next Saturday calculation, Zod validation, and graceful missing field handling. Pure function but data-heavy."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 31,
			"taskTitle": "Update HomePage for Meal Plan Display",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) Conditional rendering logic for no-plan vs has-plan states using storage utils, 2) Stats calculation and responsive UI layout with buttons.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate: Involves state-based conditional UI (hero vs summary), storage integration for counts/budget, responsive grid, and button actions. Straightforward but requires clean state management and layout work."

			"taskId": 32,
			"taskTitle": "Add /generating Route to Router",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Low complexity: Simple route addition to existing router system, mapping /generating to GenerationStatusPage, preserving Slice 1 routes and back-button handling. Minimal changes to established pattern."

			"taskTitle": "Save Generated Data to localStorage on Completion",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "",
			"reasoning": "Low-moderate: Straightforward integration in existing 'complete' handler using storage utils, Zod validation, error handling, and custom event dispatch. Reuses established patterns with minimal new logic."

			"taskId": 34,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Error Handling and Retry Logic",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: 1) SSE error/retry UI and reconnection logic, 2) Timeout, network, and storage error handling with logging and 'Start Over' functionality.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate: Extends existing component with multiple error states (SSE error, timeout, network, storage), retry SSE reconnection preserving POST body, structured logging, and state clearing. Increases cognitive complexity with conditional flows."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 35,
			"taskTitle": "End-to-End Testing and Polish",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into: 1) E2E flow testing (happy path + edge cases), 2) UI polish (animations, skeletons, responsive), 3) Event listener integration and debouncing.",
			"reasoning": "Moderate: Comprehensive manual E2E testing across dependencies, edge case handling (debounce, corrupt JSON, offline), CSS polish (@keyframes, skeletons), and event coordination. Execution-heavy rather than algorithmic."
