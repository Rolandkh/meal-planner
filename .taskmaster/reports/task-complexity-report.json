			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Set up app shell with Tailwind CSS",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - straightforward HTML boilerplate creation with CDN integration.",
			"reasoning": "Basic HTML file creation with standard meta tags, Tailwind CDN, and single script import. No logic, state management, or external dependencies. Purely structural with manual verification testing."
		},

			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement hash-based router",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - single class implementation with standard hashchange event handling and basic route mapping.",
			"reasoning": "Simple class-based router with event listener, basic path matching, and DOM manipulation. Low cyclomatic complexity (few decision points), standard browser API usage, dependency on task 16."
		},

			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Create HomePage component",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - single component with DOM creation and single event dispatch.",
			"reasoning": "Straightforward class with render method creating static DOM elements and dispatching custom event. Minimal logic, Tailwind styling, depends on router from task 17."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Build ChatWidget component UI",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Create DOM structure and styling, 2) Implement toggle/open-close functionality, 3) Add message rendering methods.",
			"reasoning": "Complex DOM construction with responsive design (mobile/desktop), multiple sub-components (header, messages, input), event handling, and state management. Higher cognitive complexity due to nested element creation and responsive Tailwind classes."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement chat streaming API endpoint",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Serverless function setup and input validation, 2) Anthropic SDK streaming integration with SSE, 3) Error handling and timeout management.",
			"reasoning": "Serverless Edge runtime with streaming SSE, external Anthropic SDK integration, async generators, TransformStream handling, error boundaries, and environment variable management. High complexity due to streaming protocols and third-party API orchestration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Connect ChatWidget to API with streaming",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Implement sendMessage API integration, 2) SSE stream parsing and real-time UI updates, 3) Error handling and state synchronization.",
			"reasoning": "Complex async fetch with ReadableStream parsing, real-time DOM updates during streaming, message state management, error recovery, and UI synchronization. High cyclomatic complexity from stream processing loops and error conditions."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement conversation persistence with localStorage",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Create storage utility module, 2) Integrate load/save into ChatWidget lifecycle.",
			"reasoning": "Utility module creation plus ChatWidget integration with load-on-init, save-on-send, and render-on-toggle logic. Moderate complexity from state hydration and error handling, but standard localStorage patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Add mobile responsiveness to chat widget",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Update container classes for responsive behavior, 2) Implement resize event handling and body class management.",
			"reasoning": "CSS class updates for Tailwind responsive design plus resize event listener and dynamic body class manipulation. Moderate complexity from viewport breakpoint logic and keyboard handling considerations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Implement error handling",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Create centralized ErrorHandler utility, 2) Integrate error boundaries across ChatWidget and API endpoint.",
			"reasoning": "Centralized error utility plus integration across multiple components (ChatWidget, storage, API). Involves error classification, user-facing messages, timeouts, and recovery patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 25,
			"taskTitle": "Test and validate Slice 1 implementation",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into: 1) Create test utilities and health-check endpoint, 2) Execute cross-browser/device testing, 3) Document results and create validation report.",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing across functional, responsive, error, and performance dimensions. Multiple environments (browsers, devices), test utility implementation, and documentation. High coordination complexity despite individual tests being simple."
