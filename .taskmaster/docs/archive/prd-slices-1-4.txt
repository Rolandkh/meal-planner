## SLICE 1: Chat with Vanessa (MVP Foundation) ✅ COMPLETE

### Goal
Build a working chat interface where users can talk to Vanessa and conversations persist.

### End-to-End Flow
```
1. User opens app
2. User sees simple home page with chat button
3. User opens chat widget
4. User types a message
5. Message sent to /api/chat-with-vanessa
6. Vanessa responds with streaming text (SSE)
7. Response displays in real-time
8. Conversation saved to localStorage
9. On page reload, conversation history is restored
```

### What This Slice Includes

**Frontend Components:**

  - Typing indicator during streaming
  - Mobile: full-screen overlay
  - Desktop: side panel

**Backend:**
- `POST /api/chat-with-vanessa` - SSE streaming endpoint
  - Accepts: message, conversation history
  - Returns: Server-Sent Events stream
  - Uses Claude Sonnet API

**Data Storage (localStorage):**
- `conversation` - Array of messages with role, content, timestamp
- `baseSpecification` - Stub user profile (hardcoded for now)

**Utilities:**
- `src/utils/storage.js` - Save/load conversation
- `src/utils/state.js` - App state management
- `src/utils/router.js` - Simple hash-based router (/, /chat)

### What This Slice Does NOT Include
- Normalized data model (eaters, recipes, meals) - Slice 2
- Meal plan generation - Slice 2
- Onboarding flow - Slice 2
- Recipe library - Slice 3
- Usage metering - Slice 3
- Add recipe flow - Slice 4
- Offline mode - Slice 4
- Mobile polish - Final polish phase

### Technical Requirements for Slice 1

**Chat API Endpoint:**
```javascript
// POST /api/chat-with-vanessa
// Request:
{
  message: string,
  chatHistory: [{ role: 'user'|'assistant', content: string }]
}

// Response: Server-Sent Events
data: {"type": "token", "content": "Hi"}
data: {"type": "token", "content": " there!"}
data: {"type": "done"}
```

**Vanessa System Prompt (Slice 1 - Simple):**
```
You are Vanessa, a friendly meal planning assistant. 
Keep responses concise (2-3 sentences).
Help users think about their meal planning needs.
You cannot generate meal plans yet - that feature is coming soon.
```

**localStorage Structure (Slice 1):**
```javascript
{
  'vanessa_conversation': {
    messages: [
      { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hi! I\'m Vanessa...', timestamp: '...' },
      { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!', timestamp: '...' }
    ],
    startedAt: '2025-12-19T...'
  }
}
```

### Success Criteria for Slice 1
- ✅ App loads with home page showing chat button
- ✅ Clicking chat opens the chat widget
- ✅ User can type and send a message
- ✅ Vanessa responds with streaming text
- ✅ Messages display in real-time as they stream
- ✅ Conversation persists after page reload
- ✅ Chat can be closed and reopened
- ✅ Works on mobile (full-screen) and desktop (side panel)
- ✅ Basic error handling (network errors show message)
- ✅ "Generate Week" button always visible in chat
- ✅ Auto-resize textarea as user types

### Known Unknowns (to evaluate after Slice 1)
- Is the streaming UX smooth enough?
- Is the chat widget responsive enough on mobile?
- Are there edge cases with SSE streaming?
- Is the conversation storage approach scalable?
- What patterns should be standardized before Slice 2?

## SLICE 2: Meal Plan Generation ✅ COMPLETE

### Goal
Add the ability to generate a complete weekly meal plan with shopping list.

### End-to-End Flow (AS BUILT)
```
1. User chats with Vanessa about preferences (optional)
2. User clicks "✨ Generate Week" button (always visible in chat widget)
3. Chat widget closes automatically
4. App navigates to #/generating route
5. GenerationStatusPage displays with animated progress bar
6. SSE stream provides real-time progress updates (10% → 25% → 50% → 75% → 90% → 95%)
7. Claude generates 7-day meal plan (21 meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner)
8. Response parsed, validated, and transformed to normalized format
9. Data saved to localStorage (recipes, meals, mealPlan)
10. Raw AI output saved to debug_raw_ai_output for debugging
11. Automatic redirect to home page showing meal plan summary
12. On failure: error message with "Retry" and "Start Over" buttons
```

### What This Slice Built

### Data Model (AS IMPLEMENTED)

**Recipe Object:**
```javascript
{
  recipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',
  name: 'Recipe Name',
  ingredients: [
    {
      name: 'ingredient name',
      quantity: number,
      unit: 'g' | 'ml' | 'whole' | etc.,
      category: 'produce' | 'meat' | 'dairy' | 'pantry' | 'other'
    }
  ],
  instructions: 'Brief instructions (2-3 sentences max)',
  prepTime: number,        // minutes
  cookTime: number,        // minutes
  servings: number,
  tags: ['tag1', 'tag2'],
  source: 'generated',
  rating: null,
  createdAt: 'ISO 8601 timestamp'
}
```

**Meal Object:**
```javascript
{
  mealId: 'meal_[uuid]',
  recipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',
  mealType: 'breakfast' | 'lunch' | 'dinner',
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  eaterIds: [],            // Empty for now, used in Slice 3
  servings: number,
  notes: ''
}
```

**MealPlan Object:**
```javascript
{
  _schemaVersion: 1,
  mealPlanId: 'plan_YYYYMMDD',
  weekOf: 'YYYY-MM-DD',    // Saturday start
  weekEnd: 'YYYY-MM-DD',   // Friday end
  createdAt: 'ISO 8601 timestamp',
  mealIds: ['meal_uuid1', 'meal_uuid2', ...],  // 21 meals
  budget: {
    target: 0,             // Not used yet
    estimated: number      // Calculated from recipes
  },
  weeklyPreferences: '',   // Empty for now
  conversation: {
    messages: []           // Empty for now, used in Slice 3
  }
}
```

### System Prompt (Meal Plan Generation)
```
You are Vanessa, an expert meal planning assistant. Generate a complete 7-day meal plan.

CRITICAL: Your response must be ONLY valid JSON in this EXACT format with NO additional text.

Guidelines:
- Generate exactly 7 days of meals (21 total: breakfast, lunch, dinner each day)
- Keep instructions BRIEF (2-3 sentences max per recipe)
- Include realistic estimated budget in dollars
- Consider user's dietary preferences and restrictions
- Vary recipes throughout the week
- Use 3-6 main ingredients per recipe (keep it simple)
- Focus on practical, quick recipes

CRITICAL - Units:
- Use ONLY metric units in ingredient quantities
- Liquids: milliliters (ml) or liters
- Solids: grams (g) or kilograms (kg)
- DO NOT use: ounces, pounds, cups, tablespoons, teaspoons
- Exception: Count items can use "whole" (e.g., "2 whole onions")
```

### What This Slice Does NOT Include (Deferred)
- Full onboarding flow (hardcoded default eater used)
- Eaters management UI
- Recipe library browsing
- Recipe favorites/ratings (data structure exists, UI pending)
- Usage metering/limits
- Edit/modify meal plan
- Regenerate single day
- Shopping list check-off persistence
- Export meal plan to PDF/markdown (debug export only)

## REALITY CHECK: Slice 2 Learnings

### What Worked Well ✅

1. **SSE Streaming for Progress**
   - Real-time progress updates provide excellent UX
   - Users see what's happening during 30-60 second generation
   - Pattern works well, should be reused for long operations

2. **Data Transformation Layer**
   - Clean separation between Claude's output and our storage format
   - Recipe deduplication works perfectly (hash-based on name + ingredients)
   - Easy to add validation and error handling in one place

3. **localStorage Strategy**
   - Simple, fast, no backend needed
   - Quota handling prevents silent failures
   - Debug output saved separately is invaluable for troubleshooting

4. **Unit Conversion System**
   - Comprehensive mapping handles 70+ ingredients
   - Metric-only shopping lists are clearer for Australian users
   - Fuzzy matching for ingredient variations works well

5. **Chat Context Integration**
   - Last 10 chat messages provide excellent context to Claude
   - Users can specify constraints ("30 ingredients max") and they work
   - No need for separate preference forms (yet)

6. **Component Lifecycle Hooks**
   - `afterRender()` hook perfect for triggering async operations
   - `beforeUnload()` for cleanup works well
   - Router's component pattern is flexible and simple

### What Was Awkward / Could Improve 🤔

1. **Shopping List Aggregation Complexity**
   - The aggregation logic is quite complex (300+ lines)
   - Multiple passes needed: collect → aggregate → convert → dedupe
   - Hard to debug when ingredients don't combine as expected
   - **Learning**: Consider pre-processing ingredient names during generation

2. **Metric-Only Requirement**
   - System prompt says "metric only" but Claude sometimes forgets
   - We have fallback conversion, but adds complexity
   - **Learning**: May need stricter validation or retry logic

3. **Storage Keys Mix**
   - Some keys namespaced (`vanessa-chat-history`), some not (`recipes`, `eaters`)
   - Inconsistent naming convention
   - **Learning**: Standardize on `vanessa_` prefix for all keys in Slice 3

4. **No Eater Management Yet**
   - Hardcoded default eater works, but feels incomplete
   - Users can't specify household members yet
   - **Learning**: Slice 3 should add eater management before recipe library

5. **Error Messages Could Be Better**
   - Some errors just say "Generation failed"
   - No guidance on what to do (check internet? try again? contact support?)
   - **Learning**: Add more specific error types with actionable messages

6. **No Way to Modify Generated Plan**
   - If user doesn't like one recipe, they must regenerate entire week
   - **Learning**: Slice 3 or 4 should add "regenerate day" or "swap recipe" feature

### Technical Discoveries 🔍

1. **Vercel Edge Runtime Limits**
   - 90-second timeout is hard limit
   - 8192 max_tokens usually sufficient for 7-day plan
   - Lower temperature (0.7) produces faster, more focused output

2. **Claude Sonnet 4.5 Performance**
   - Excellent at following JSON structure requirements
   - Occasionally adds markdown code fences (we strip them)
   - Honors conversation context very well
   - Budget estimates are reasonable but not accurate

3. **localStorage Quota**
   - ~5MB limit sufficient for multiple weeks
   - One week = ~50-100KB (recipes + meals + plan)
   - Could store 20-30 weeks before hitting quota
   - Debug output can fill quickly if not pruned

4. **Recipe Deduplication**
   - Hash-based approach works perfectly
   - Same recipe across multiple days correctly shares one Recipe object
   - Saves significant storage space

### Architecture Patterns Established 📐

1. **Data Flow:**
   ```
   User Intent → Chat Widget → API Endpoint → Claude API
                                   ↓
   Raw JSON → Transformer → Normalized Data → localStorage
                                   ↓
                          View Components → Display
   ```

2. **Component Pattern:**
   - Each page is a class with `render()` method
   - Optional lifecycle hooks: `beforeRender()`, `afterRender()`, `beforeUnload()`
   - Components return HTMLElement or string
   - Router manages mounting/unmounting

3. **Error Handling:**
   - Try/catch at every async boundary
   - `ErrorHandler` utility for consistent messaging
   - Graceful degradation (show error, offer retry)
   - Log errors to console for debugging

4. **Storage Pattern:**
   - `load*()` functions return data or default (never throw)
   - `save*()` functions return result object with success/error
   - Validation happens before save
   - Atomic saves (all or nothing)

### Decisions Made 📝

1. **Week Start = Saturday**
   - Aligns with shopping day (Saturday morning)
   - Plan covers Sat → Fri (7 days)
   - Hardcoded for now, could be user preference later

2. **Metric Units Only**
   - Australian market preference
   - Simpler for shopping (no cups/tbsp)
   - All conversions go one direction (imperial → metric)

3. **No Database Yet**
   - localStorage sufficient for Phase 1
   - Defer Firebase/backend until usage metering needed (Slice 4)
   - Keeps deployment simple (static site)

4. **Chat History Context Limit**
   - Last 10 messages passed to generation
   - Enough for recent context, not too much tokens
   - Prevents prompt bloat

5. **Debug Output Saved**
   - Raw AI output saved to `debug_raw_ai_output`
   - Single key (overwrites each generation)
   - Export button on home page for debugging

### Ready for Slice 3? ✅

**Prerequisites Met:**
- ✅ Core generation flow works end-to-end
- ✅ Data model is stable and proven
- ✅ Storage layer is robust
- ✅ UI patterns established

**What Slice 3 Needs:**
1. Eater management (add/edit household members)
2. Preference settings (dietary restrictions, allergies)
3. Recipe library view (browse saved recipes)
4. Recipe detail view with favorites/ratings
5. Conversation history saved to meal plan
6. Standardize storage keys

**Blockers:** None. Ready to proceed.

  for (let i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++) {
    const key = localStorage.key(i);
    const value = localStorage.getItem(key);
    totalBytes += (key.length + value.length) * 2; // UTF-16 = 2 bytes per char
  }
  
  const limitBytes = 5 * 1024 * 1024; // 5MB
  const percentUsed = (totalBytes / limitBytes) * 100;
  
  return {
    usedBytes: totalBytes,
    usedMB: (totalBytes / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2),
    limitMB: 5,
    percentUsed: percentUsed.toFixed(1),
    remainingMB: ((limitBytes - totalBytes) / 1024 / 1024).toFixed(2),
    warning: percentUsed > 80 ? 'critical' : percentUsed > 60 ? 'warning' : 'ok'
  };
}
```

      try {
        const imported = JSON.parse(e.target.result);
        
        // Validate version
        if (imported._exportVersion !== 1) {
          throw new Error('Incompatible backup version');
        }
        
        // Restore all data

    success: true,
    cleared: 0,
    kept: 1,
    spaceSaved: 0
  };
}

export function deleteOrphanedRecipes() {
  const recipes = loadRecipes();
  const meals = loadMeals();
  
  // Get all recipe IDs currently in use
  const usedRecipeIds = new Set(meals.map(m => m.recipeId));
  
  // Find orphaned recipes
  const orphaned = recipes.filter(r => !usedRecipeIds.has(r.recipeId));
  
  if (orphaned.length === 0) {
    return { success: true, deleted: 0, remaining: recipes.length };
  }
  
  // Keep only used recipes
  const remaining = recipes.filter(r => usedRecipeIds.has(r.recipeId));
  const result = saveRecipes(remaining);
  
  return {
    success: result.success,

function migrateToSlice3() {
  // 1. Rename storage keys
  renameKey('recipes', 'vanessa_recipes');
  renameKey('meals', 'vanessa_meals');
  renameKey('currentMealPlan', 'vanessa_current_meal_plan');
  renameKey('debug_raw_ai_output', 'vanessa_debug_raw_output');
  
  // 2. Create default eater if none exists
  if (!loadEaters().length) {
    const defaultEater = {
      eaterId: 'eater_' + crypto.randomUUID(),
      name: 'User',
      preferences: 'no restrictions',
      allergies: [],
      dietaryRestrictions: [],
      schedule: 'home for dinner',
      isDefault: true,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    saveEaters([defaultEater]);
  }
  
  // 3. Create base specification if none exists
  if (!loadBaseSpecification()) {
    const eaters = loadEaters();
    const ownerEater = eaters.find(e => e.isDefault) || eaters[0];
    
    const baseSpec = {
      _schemaVersion: 1,
      ownerEaterId: ownerEater.eaterId,
      weeklyBudget: 150,
      shoppingDay: 6, // Saturday
      preferredStore: '',
      householdEaterIds: eaters.map(e => e.eaterId),
      dietaryGoals: '',
      onboardingComplete: false, // Will trigger onboarding
      conversation: {
        startedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
        messages: []
      },
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
      updatedAt: new Date().toISOString()
    };
    saveBaseSpecification(baseSpec);
  }
  
  // 4. Add rating/favorite fields to existing recipes
  const recipes = loadRecipes();
  const updated = recipes.map(r => ({
    ...r,
    isFavorite: r.isFavorite ?? false,
    rating: r.rating ?? null,
    timesCooked: r.timesCooked ?? 0,
    lastCooked: r.lastCooked ?? null
  }));
  saveRecipes(updated);
  
  // 5. Set migration flag
  localStorage.setItem('vanessa_migration_slice3', 'complete');
}
```

**Storage Enhancements (localStorage + Features):**
- ✅ **Storage Quota Monitoring**
  - Track localStorage usage (bytes used / 5MB limit)
  - Show warning banner at 80% capacity
  - Display storage stats in settings
  
- ✅ **Export/Import Functionality**
  - Export all data to JSON file (complete backup)
  - Import from JSON file (restore data)
  - Download format: `vanessa-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.json`
  
- ✅ **Data Cleanup Features**
  - Clear old meal plans (keep last 4 weeks)
  - Delete unused recipes (not in any meal plan)
  - Manual cleanup UI in settings
  - Show space saved after cleanup

**Storage Architecture Decision:**
- Continue with localStorage for Slice 3
- Quota: 5MB = ~20-30 weeks of data (sufficient)
- Migration to Firebase deferred to Slice 4 (when usage metering added)
- Storage abstraction layer makes future migration easy (1-2 days work)

## REALITY CHECK: Slice 3 Learnings

**Date:** December 26, 2025  
**Version:** v0.9  
**Code Written:** ~4,500 lines (3,500 new + 1,000 enhanced)

### What Worked Exceptionally Well ✅

1. **Two-Phase AI Extraction System**
   - **Phase 1:** Extract structured schedule from conversation
   - **Phase 2:** Generate with explicit date-mapped requirements
   - **Result:** Claude now respects complex schedules accurately (Tuesday dinner = 3 servings, Thursday lunch = 1 serving)
   - **Learning:** Free-form conversation + structured extraction is the ideal UX
   - **Pattern Established:** AI conversations → Structured data → Explicit requirements

2. **Visual Feedback During Long Operations**
   - Typing indicators (`...`) prevent "is it broken?" moments
   - Progress messages show what's happening ("👥 Creating household profiles...")
   - Users understand the system is working
   - **Learning:** Visual feedback is critical for AI operations taking >2 seconds
   - **Pattern:** Always show progress for operations >1 second

3. **Household Schedule Grid**
   - Visual calendar showing who eats when (color-coded dots)
   - Instant clarity on complex schedules
   - Eliminates confusion about serving sizes
   - **Learning:** Visual representation > text description for schedules
   - **Pattern:** Use color-coding for multi-person scenarios

4. **AI-Powered Household Extraction**
   - Automatically creates profiles from conversation (Maya, Cathie, etc.)
   - Extracts ages, relationships, preferences
   - **Failsafe:** Creates profiles even if AI parsing fails (name detection)
   - **Learning:** Two-layer extraction (AI + regex fallback) ensures reliability
   - **Pattern:** Always have non-AI fallback for critical operations

5. **Ingredient Limit Constraint**
   - 46 items → overwhelming
   - 30 items → manageable
   - Constraint forces intelligent ingredient reuse
   - **Learning:** Constraints improve quality by forcing optimization
   - **Pattern:** Use limits to guide AI toward better solutions

6. **Voice-Activated Generation**
   - "Plan my week" auto-triggers generation
   - AI signals with marker, system detects and acts
   - No button click needed
   - **Learning:** Natural language commands improve UX
   - **Pattern:** AI can signal intent, system can act on signals

7. **Settings Page Architecture (4 Sections)**
   - Storage, Household, Meal Planning, Chat Preferences
   - 1,200+ lines but well-organized
   - Modal forms prevent page clutter
   - Auto-save with debounce (300ms)
   - **Learning:** Large components benefit from tab/section organization
   - **Pattern:** Modal forms + auto-save = cleaner UX

8. **Dev Presets for Testing**
   - Bypass 5-minute onboarding with 2-second preset load
   - Pre-configured household (Roland, Maya, Cathie)
   - Sample meal plan ready to test
   - **Learning:** Dev tools dramatically speed up iteration
   - **Pattern:** Always provide test data shortcuts for development

### What Was Awkward / Could Improve 🤔

1. **Date-to-Day Mapping Complexity**
   - Schedule uses day names (Sunday, Monday)
   - Generation uses dates (2025-12-29)
   - Must explicitly map in prompts ("TUESDAY Dec 31")
   - **Challenge:** Claude doesn't automatically know which date is which day
   - **Solution:** Explicit mapping in system prompt
   - **Future:** Consider having AI handle this mapping automatically

2. **AI API Call Costs**
   - Onboarding now uses 3 AI calls (chat + household extraction + schedule extraction)
   - Cost: ~$0.15 per onboarding (acceptable)
   - **Concern:** Cost grows with features
   - **Learning:** Monitor API usage carefully
   - **Future:** Consider caching common extractions

3. **localStorage Near Limits**
   - Rich profiles + schedules consume more space
   - Need active quota monitoring
   - **Current:** 5MB limit = ~20-30 weeks
   - **Learning:** localStorage sufficient for now, but migration to Firebase needed soon
   - **Pattern:** Monitor and warn early (60% = warning, 80% = critical)

4. **Browser Caching During Development**
   - Must hard-refresh to see updates
   - Can be frustrating during rapid iteration
   - **Learning:** Not an issue for users in production
   - **Pattern:** Add cache-busting for development builds

5. **Complex Prompts Getting Long**
   - Generation system prompt is now 200+ lines
   - Includes: schedule, eaters, constraints, examples
   - **Concern:** Token usage, maintainability
   - **Learning:** Long prompts are acceptable if results are good
   - **Future:** Consider prompt compression techniques

6. **Testing Blocked by API Quota**
   - Can't fully test until Jan 1, 2026
   - Built features based on theoretical understanding
   - **Learning:** Need test accounts with separate quotas
   - **Future:** Multiple API keys for testing vs. production

### Technical Discoveries 🔍

1. **Structured Schedule Format**
   ```javascript
   weeklySchedule: {
     sunday: {
       breakfast: { servings: 1, eaterIds: ['eater_1'], requirements: 'Quick, kid-friendly' }
       // ...
     }
   }
   ```
   - Works perfectly for explicit requirements
   - Easy to map to dates during generation
   - Human-readable structure

2. **Smart EaterIds Assignment**
   - Transformer looks up schedule by date + mealType
   - Assigns correct eaterIds to each meal
   - Grid display automatically shows right dots
   - **Pattern:** Data structure enables UI automation

3. **Failsafe Household Creation**
   - If AI extraction fails, regex finds names
   - Always creates at least default profiles
   - Prevents onboarding failures
   - **Pattern:** Multiple extraction layers for reliability

4. **Component Modularity Win**
   - Built 4 major components in parallel
   - Each independently testable
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - **Learning:** Component architecture scales well

5. **Navigation Parameterized Routes**
   - `/recipe/:id` pattern works smoothly
   - Router extracts params correctly
   - Browser back/forward work properly
   - **Pattern:** Parameterized routes + hash routing = simple SPA

### Architecture Patterns Refined 📐

1. **AI Conversation → Extraction → Generation Flow:**
   ```
   User Conversation (Natural language)
        ↓
   AI Extraction (Structured data)
        ↓
   Explicit Requirements (Unambiguous specs)
        ↓
   AI Generation (Constrained output)
        ↓
   Display (User-facing)
   ```

2. **Two-Layer Extraction Pattern:**
   - Layer 1: AI extraction (best quality)
   - Layer 2: Regex fallback (guaranteed result)
   - Result: Reliability without sacrificing quality

3. **Modal Forms for Complex Inputs:**
   - Settings page uses modals for eater forms
   - Prevents page clutter
   - Focused user attention
   - Easier validation

4. **Auto-Save with Debounce:**
   ```javascript
   handleChange(field, value) {
     clearTimeout(this.saveTimeout);
     this.saveTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
       this.saveToStorage();
       this.showSuccessToast();
     }, 300);
   }
   ```
   - Smooth UX without explicit save buttons
   - Prevents excessive saves
   - Visual confirmation

5. **Dev Presets Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   if (isDevelopment && hasNoData) {
     showDevPresetButton();
   }
   ```
   - Visible only in development
   - One-click data loading
   - Dramatically speeds up testing

### Decisions Made 📝

1. **Ingredient Limit: 30 Items Default**
   - User-configurable (15-100)
   - Forces intelligent recipe reuse
   - Reduces shopping overwhelm
   - Can adjust based on household size

2. **Schedule-Driven Serving Sizes**
   - Each meal has explicit servings from schedule
   - No more assumptions
   - Accurate shopping lists
   - Grid display shows attendance

3. **Onboarding: Conversation over Forms**
   - Natural chat feels better than forms
   - AI extracts data automatically
   - Users can express nuances
   - More flexible than structured input

4. **Storage: Continue localStorage for Now**
   - Sufficient capacity (~20-30 weeks)
   - Zero cost
   - Offline-first
   - Migration to Firebase deferred to Slice 4

5. **Navigation: Single Header Bar**
   - Sticky at top
   - Mobile hamburger <768px
   - All major routes accessible
   - Active link highlighting

6. **Reality Check Format: Document in PRD**
   - Keep learnings in single source of truth
   - Easy to reference during Slice 4 planning
   - Informs future architectural decisions

## REALITY CHECK: Slice 4 Learnings

**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Version:** v1.0-rc2  
**Code Written:** ~2,700 lines (2,500 new + 200 fixes)  
**Time Spent:** ~12 hours total (8 hours build + 4 hours testing/fixes)

### What Worked Exceptionally Well ✅

1. **Vertical Slice Methodology Proven**
   - Built 4 complete features in ~1 week
   - Each feature independently shippable
   - Testing revealed issues early, fixed quickly
   - **Learning:** Slice-by-slice approach enables rapid iteration with quality
   - **Pattern Established:** Build → Test → Fix → Document → Next Slice

2. **Autonomous Development with Testing Checkpoints**
   - AI built all 10 tasks autonomously (~2 hours)
   - User testing found 3 critical bugs
   - All bugs fixed within 4 hours
   - **Learning:** AI can build quickly, but user testing is essential for catching logic bugs
   - **Pattern:** Autonomous build → Manual test → Targeted fixes → Re-test

3. **SessionStorage for Navigation Context**
   - Used sessionStorage to pass regeneration parameters between components
   - Clean, automatic cleanup
   - No URL pollution
   - **Learning:** Perfect for temporary navigation state that shouldn't persist
   - **Pattern Established:** Use sessionStorage for cross-component temporary data

4. **Conversational Workflows Over Modals**
   - Replaced modal-based regeneration with chat-based workflow
   - Users describe changes naturally
   - Vanessa clarifies and confirms
   - More flexible than rigid forms
   - **Learning:** Natural language is more user-friendly than structured forms for complex operations
   - **Pattern:** Chat integration > Modals for user intent capture

5. **Message Formatting with HTML**
   - Enabled HTML rendering in chat messages
   - Bold headings, colored boxes, bullet points
   - Dramatically improved readability
   - **Learning:** Structured formatting is crucial for complex information in chat
   - **Pattern:** Use HTML formatting for multi-part chat messages

6. **Auto-Archive with Snapshot Pattern**
   - Old meal plans automatically archived on new generation
   - Frozen snapshots prevent data corruption
   - Clean separation between active and historical data
   - **Learning:** Snapshot pattern ensures historical data integrity
   - **Pattern Established:** Create immutable copies for archival

7. **Component Re-Render Strategies**
   - Learned to use targeted updates (renderIngredients()) vs full re-render
   - Prevents DOM recreation and improves performance
   - **Learning:** Partial updates better than full component re-renders
   - **Pattern:** Create targeted render methods for dynamic sections

8. **Visual Feedback Essential**
   - Save confirmation (green button) prevents user confusion
   - Context-aware button text ("Generate" vs "Generate Week")
   - Loading states during AI operations
   - **Learning:** Users need immediate visual confirmation for all actions
   - **Pattern:** Every action requires visual state feedback

### What Was Awkward / Could Improve 🤔

1. **Data Merging Complexity**
   - **Challenge:** GenerationStatusPage had to merge new day's meals with existing 6 days
   - Initial implementation replaced all meals (critical bug)
   - Required careful state tracking (isSingleDayRegeneration, regeneratingDate)
   - **Root Issue:** No clear pattern for partial vs full data updates
   - **Learning:** Need explicit merge strategy when updating partial datasets
   - **Future Solution:** Create standardized merge utilities for common operations
   - **Pattern Needed:** updatePartialData(existing, new, mergeKey)

2. **State Management Across Components**
   - **Challenge:** Passing day context from DayView → ChatWidget → GenerationStatusPage → back
   - Used sessionStorage as band-aid solution
   - No centralized state management
   - **Root Issue:** Vanilla JS lacks state management framework
   - **Learning:** As app grows, lack of state management becomes friction point
   - **Future Consideration:** May need lightweight state manager (Zustand, Nanostores) for Slice 5+
   - **Current Workaround:** SessionStorage + component props works, but getting complex

3. **Component Lifecycle Complexity**
   - **Challenge:** RecipeEditPage needed auto-save, draft management, beforeUnload
   - Multiple timers to track (saveTimeout, saveSuccessTimeout)
   - Manual cleanup required
   - **Root Issue:** No built-in lifecycle management
   - **Learning:** Complex components need explicit cleanup patterns
   - **Pattern Established:** Track all timers in component state, cleanup in destroy()

4. **Testing Automation Gap**
   - **Challenge:** Automated browser tests caught UI issues but missed logic bugs
   - Critical bugs only found during manual user testing
   - No automated tests for data merging logic
   - **Learning:** Need unit tests for critical data operations, not just UI tests
   - **Future:** Add Jest/Vitest for unit testing storage and transformation logic

5. **API Endpoint Complexity Growth**
   - **Challenge:** generate-meal-plan.js now handles full week + single day + various parameters
   - 400+ lines in single endpoint
   - Validation spread throughout
   - **Learning:** API endpoints becoming monolithic
   - **Future Refactor:** Consider splitting into multiple endpoints or extracting shared logic

6. **UI Iterations Required**
   - **Challenge:** Took 6+ iterations to get button colors right
   - Gradient transparency issues on colored backgrounds
   - Trial-and-error approach
   - **Learning:** UI polish requires iteration, but slows development
   - **Pattern:** Defer visual polish until feature complete, then batch refine

7. **Documentation Lag**
   - **Challenge:** Documentation written after implementation
   - Easy to miss details or forget context
   - Had to reconstruct learnings from code
   - **Learning:** Document learnings immediately, not at end of slice
   - **Pattern:** Create LEARNINGS.md during development, update in real-time

### Technical Discoveries 🔍

1. **RecipeEditPage Re-Render Bug**
   - Calling `this.render()` created new DOM container but didn't replace old one
   - Solution: Create targeted update methods (renderIngredients())
   - **Discovery:** Full component re-renders don't work in vanilla JS component pattern
   - **Fix:** Partial DOM updates via targeted methods

2. **MealPlan History Snapshot Requirements**
   - Must freeze meals AND recipes together
   - Recipe references can change, breaking historical plans
   - Solution: Store complete snapshots with embedded recipe data
   - **Discovery:** Relational data needs denormalization for archival

3. **Save Confirmation UX Pattern**
   - Button color change + text change + timeout = clear feedback
   - 5 seconds is optimal (long enough to see, short enough not to annoy)
   - **Discovery:** State transitions need visual + temporal components

4. **SessionStorage Auto-Cleanup**
   - Perfect for single-use parameters
   - Automatically cleared on generation completion
   - No manual cleanup needed
   - **Discovery:** SessionStorage ideal for one-time navigation context

5. **Recipe Import Confidence Scoring**
   - AI extraction accuracy varies widely by source
   - Preview/edit step essential for low-confidence (<70%)
   - **Discovery:** Always show preview for AI-extracted data, regardless of confidence

6. **Single-Day Generation Speed**
   - Only 3 meals vs 21 meals
   - Takes ~20-30 seconds vs 60-90 seconds
   - Users prefer faster partial updates
   - **Discovery:** Granular operations improve UX even if technically more complex

### Architecture Patterns Established 📐

1. **Merge Strategy Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   // For partial updates of array data
   const mergePartialData = (existing, newItems, matchKey, matchValue) => {
     const filtered = existing.filter(item => item[matchKey] !== matchValue);
     return [...filtered, ...newItems];
   };
   
   // Example: Merge single day's meals
   const existingMeals = loadMeals();
   const otherDays = existingMeals.filter(m => m.date !== regeneratingDate);
   const updated = [...otherDays, ...newMeals];
   ```

2. **Snapshot Archival Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   // Create immutable historical snapshot
   const createSnapshot = (mealPlan) => {
     const meals = loadMeals().filter(m => 
       mealPlan.mealIds.includes(m.mealId)
     );
     const recipeIds = [...new Set(meals.map(m => m.recipeId))];
     const recipes = loadRecipes().filter(r => 
       recipeIds.includes(r.recipeId)
     );
     
     return {
       ...mealPlan,
       archivedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
       mealsSnapshot: meals,      // Frozen copy
       recipesSnapshot: recipes   // Frozen copy
     };
   };
   ```

3. **Targeted Re-Render Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   class Component {
     // Full render (initial only)
     render() {
       const container = document.createElement('div');
       container.innerHTML = this.template();
       this.attachEventListeners(container);
       return container;
     }
     
     // Targeted updates (after initial render)
     renderSection() {
       const section = document.getElementById('section-id');
       section.innerHTML = this.sectionTemplate();
       this.attachSectionListeners(section);
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Save Confirmation Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   class EditPage {
     async handleSave() {
       this.saveSuccess = false;
       this.updateSaveButton(); // Blue "Save Changes"
       
       await saveData();
       
       this.saveSuccess = true;
       this.updateSaveButton(); // Green "Saved ✓"
       
       this.saveSuccessTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
         this.saveSuccess = false;
         this.updateSaveButton(); // Back to blue
       }, 5000);
     }
     
     destroy() {
       clearTimeout(this.saveSuccessTimeout);
     }
   }
   ```

5. **SessionStorage Navigation Context Pattern:**
   ```javascript
   // Component A: Set context
   openChatForDayChanges(day, date, meals) {
     sessionStorage.setItem('regenerate_day', day);
     sessionStorage.setItem('regenerate_date', date);
     sessionStorage.setItem('regenerate_meals', JSON.stringify(meals));
     // Open chat or navigate
   }
   
   // Component B: Read context
   const dayContext = sessionStorage.getItem('regenerate_day');
   if (dayContext) {
     // Handle single-day regeneration
     sessionStorage.removeItem('regenerate_day'); // Cleanup after use
   }
   ```

### Decisions Made 📝

1. **Conversational Over Modal for Complex Changes**
   - Replaced "Regenerate Day" modal with "Make Changes" chat workflow
   - Natural language more flexible than form fields
   - Users can describe nuances
   - **Rationale:** Better UX for non-deterministic operations

2. **Merge Not Replace for Partial Updates**
   - Always merge new data with existing when updating subset
   - Never replace entire dataset for partial operation
   - **Rationale:** Prevents data loss bugs

3. **Summary Over Stats for Meal Plans**
   - Removed numerical stats (21 meals, 6 recipes, $115)
   - Added descriptive summary ("Mediterranean weight loss week")
   - Moved budget to Shopping List where it's actionable
   - **Rationale:** Storytelling > Data, Context > Numbers

4. **Solid Backgrounds for Buttons on Colored Surfaces**
   - Gradient buttons had transparency issues on colored backgrounds
   - Switched to solid backgrounds for those contexts
   - **Rationale:** Avoid visual bleeding, ensure readability

5. **5-Second Save Confirmation**
   - Long enough to see feedback
   - Short enough not to be annoying
   - Auto-resets without user action
   - **Rationale:** Balance visibility with UX flow

6. **SessionStorage for Single-Use Context**
   - Used for regeneration day parameters
   - Automatically cleaned up after use
   - **Rationale:** Simpler than props drilling or state management

7. **Separate Edit Page from Detail Page**
   - Could have made RecipeDetailPage editable
   - Chose separate RecipeEditPage instead
   - **Rationale:** Cleaner separation, easier state management

8. **Auto-Archive on Generation**
   - Every new meal plan archives the previous one
   - No manual save required
   - **Rationale:** Preserves history automatically, reduces user burden

### Bugs Found & Fixed 🐛

**Critical Bugs (3):**

1. **Week Deletion on Single-Day Regeneration**
   - **Symptom:** Regenerating one day deleted entire week
   - **Root Cause:** `saveMeals(newMeals)` replaced all instead of merging
   - **Fix:** Merge strategy - filter out target day, merge with new day
   - **Impact:** High - data loss
   - **Prevention:** Unit tests for data merge operations

2. **Add Ingredient Button Non-Functional**
   - **Symptom:** Clicking did nothing
   - **Root Cause:** Called `render()` which created new DOM but didn't attach
   - **Fix:** Created `renderIngredients()` for targeted update
   - **Impact:** High - feature unusable
   - **Prevention:** Test dynamic UI interactions

3. **No Save Confirmation**
   - **Symptom:** Users unsure if save worked
   - **Root Cause:** No visual state feedback
   - **Fix:** Added save state + green button confirmation
   - **Impact:** Medium - UX confusion
   - **Prevention:** Always provide visual feedback for actions

**UI/UX Issues (6):**

4. Confusing button text (always "Generate Week")
5. Unformatted chat messages (hard to read)
6. Button transparency bleeding on colored backgrounds
7. Chat message width wasted space
8. Unclear button labels (emoji only)
9. Recipe changes appeared not to persist (actually did, just no feedback)

**All Fixed:** 100% resolution rate

### Testing Insights 🧪

1. **Automated UI Tests Miss Logic Bugs**
   - Browser tests verified UI rendered
   - Didn't catch data merging logic bug
   - **Lesson:** Need unit tests for business logic, not just integration tests

2. **User Testing Essential**
   - All 3 critical bugs found by user testing
   - Automated tests passed but features broken
   - **Lesson:** AI-built code needs human verification

3. **Test Both Entry Points**
   - Single-day regeneration accessible from DayView AND MealPlanView
   - Initial test only checked one
   - **Lesson:** Test all access paths for multi-entry features

4. **Edge Cases in Real Usage**
   - "Add ingredient then remove last one" scenario
   - Validation only triggered when tried by user
   - **Lesson:** Real usage patterns reveal edge cases automation misses

### Performance Observations 📊

1. **Recipe Edit Auto-Save:**
   - 30-second interval chosen (not too aggressive)
   - Debounced to prevent excessive saves
   - Minimal performance impact

2. **History Page Loading:**
   - Snapshot approach adds ~50KB per archived week
   - 4-week retention = ~200KB
   - Acceptable for localStorage

3. **Single-Day Generation:**
   - 20-30 seconds (vs 60-90s full week)
   - Users much prefer shorter wait
   - Worth the technical complexity

4. **Chat Message Rendering:**
   - HTML parsing in messages adds minimal overhead
   - Improved readability worth the cost

### Code Quality Metrics 📈

**Slice 4 Final Stats:**
- **Total Lines:** ~2,700 (including fixes)
- **Linter Errors:** 0 (clean build)
- **Files Created:** 6
- **Files Modified:** 13 (including fixes)
- **Components:** 4 new pages
- **Utilities:** 2 new helpers
- **API Endpoints:** 1 new, 1 enhanced

   {
     recipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',
     name: 'Spaghetti Bolognese',
     parentRecipeId: null,  // This is a parent
     childRecipeIds: ['recipe_abc', 'recipe_def'],  // Links to children
     // ... rest of recipe
   }
   
   // Child recipe:
   {
     recipeId: 'recipe_abc',
     name: 'Spaghetti Bolognese (Vegetarian)',
     parentRecipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',  // Links back to parent

1. **Prep Task Generation**
   - AI analyzes day's 3 recipes (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
   - Extracts prep tasks based on user's prep level settings
   - Considers:
     - User's prep capacity for this day/meal type
     - What can be prepped in advance vs day-of
     - Batch opportunities (prep for multiple meals)
     - Time constraints

2. **Day View Enhancement**
   - New "📋 Prep for Today" section at TOP of day view
   - Above Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner sections
   - Shows:
     - Prep task list with estimated times
     - Which meals each task supports
     - Total estimated prep time for the day
   
   **Example:**
   ```
   MONDAY, January 13
   
   📋 Prep for Today (~25 minutes)
   - Chop 2 onions, 1 bell pepper (10 min) → for lunch & dinner
   - Marinate chicken breast (5 min, refrigerate 2 hours) → for dinner
   - Cook 2 cups rice (10 min) → for lunch
   
   🌅 Breakfast: Oatmeal with berries
   🌞 Lunch: Chicken stir fry
   🌙 Dinner: Mediterranean bowl
   ```

3. **Prep Level Settings (Single-User MVP)**
   - Located in Settings → Meal Prep
   - Day-specific table (7 days × 3 meals = 21 settings)
   
   **Table Format:**
   ```
   Prep Level Legend:
   - Minimal: Simple assembly/heat
   - Medium: Cooking one or two items
   - Full: Chopping, preparing multiple ingredients, extended cooking
   
           Breakfast    Lunch       Dinner
   Mon     [Minimal]    [Minimal]   [Medium]
   Tue     [Minimal]    [Minimal]   [Full]
   Wed     [Minimal]    [Minimal]   [Medium]
   Thu     [Minimal]    [Minimal]   [Full]
   Fri     [Medium]     [Medium]    [Full]
   Sat     [Full]       [Full]      [Full]
   Sun     [Full]       [Medium]    [Medium]
   
   Batch Prep Days: [☑ Saturday] [☐ Sunday] [☐ Monday] ...
   ```

4. **AI Prompt Enhancement**
   - Include prep level constraints in generation prompt
   - Example: "Monday lunch needs minimal prep (workplace - can only heat)"
   - Claude generates recipes matching prep constraints
   - Prep tasks reflect actual user capacity

**Data Schema Updates:**
```javascript
// BaseSpecification (enhanced)
{
  // ... existing fields
  mealPrepSettings: {
    batchPrepDays: [6],  // Array of day indices (0=Sun, 6=Sat)
    prepLevels: {
      monday: { breakfast: 'minimal', lunch: 'minimal', dinner: 'medium' },
      tuesday: { breakfast: 'minimal', lunch: 'minimal', dinner: 'full' },
      // ... all 7 days
    }
  }
}

// Meal (enhanced)
{
  mealId: 'meal_[uuid]',
  recipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',
  // ... existing fields
  prepTasks: [  // NEW: AI-generated prep tasks
    {
      task: 'Chop 2 onions, 1 bell pepper',
      estimatedTime: 10,  // minutes
      timing: 'before_cooking',  // or 'day_before', 'morning_of'
      usedIn: ['lunch', 'dinner']  // Which meals use this prep
    }
  ]
}
```

**Technical Requirements:**
- Settings page: Prep level table component
- AI prompt: Include prep constraints
- Prep task extraction from recipe instructions
- DayView: Prep section at top
- Storage: Save prep settings and tasks

**Future Enhancement (Slice 7 - Multi-User):**
- Each user has own prep settings
- Meals assigned to specific preparer
- Users see only their prep tasks
- Household coordination features

---

### **Feature 6: Personal Preferences & Exclusions** ⚙️

**User Value:** Fine-tune diet profiles with personal likes/dislikes

**What It Builds:**
1. **Preferences Data Structure**
   - Separate from base diet profile
   - Stored per eater
   - Categories:
     - Exclude ingredients (allergies, dislikes)
     - Prefer ingredients (favorites, extra servings)
     - Free-text notes

2. **Settings UI Enhancement**
   - In Settings → Household → [Eater] → Edit
   - Below diet profile dropdown
   - Fields:
     - "Foods to Exclude" (comma-separated or tag chips)
     - "Foods to Prefer" (comma-separated or tag chips)
     - "Additional Notes" (textarea)

3. **Generation Integration**
   - Pass to AI: Base profile + personal preferences
   - Claude filters out excluded ingredients
   - Prioritizes preferred ingredients
   - Respects both profile rules AND personal preferences

**Example:**
```
Eater: Roland
Diet Profile: Mediterranean
Personal Preferences:
  - Exclude: eggplant, tomatoes, blue cheese
  - Prefer: extra fish, walnuts, dark chocolate
  - Notes: "Prefer dinner to be high-protein"
```

---

## End-to-End Flows

### **FLOW A: Onboarding with Diet Profile Assignment**
```
1. User opens app (first time)
2. Vanessa: "Let me learn about your eating preferences"
3. Vanessa asks: "What do you value in meals? What do you like eating? What would you prefer to avoid?"
4. User responds with preferences
5. Vanessa analyzes and suggests: "Based on what you've said, Mediterranean diet seems to fit you well. We'll assign this diet profile with notes to exclude eggplant and tomatoes. Does that sound good?"
6. User confirms
7. Profile saved: dietProfile="mediterranean", excludeIngredients=["eggplant","tomatoes"]
8. Continue onboarding (household members, budget, etc.)
```

### **FLOW B: Generating with Recipe Catalog**
```
1. User clicks "Generate Week"
2. System loads:
   - Household eaters with diet profiles
   - Recipe catalog (~800 recipes)
   - Prep level settings
   - Personal preferences
3. AI receives:
   - Catalog recipes (filtered by diet profiles)
   - Household schedule
   - Diet constraints
   - Prep constraints per day/meal
4. AI selects from catalog OR creates new if no match
5. For conflicting profiles (Keto + Vegan):
   - Generates 2 recipes for that meal
   - Labels each with eater name
6. Meal plan returned with:
   - Recipes (catalog or generated)
   - Diet Compass scores (pre-calculated for catalog)
   - Prep tasks per day
7. Display shows health scores under each recipe name
```

### **FLOW C: Viewing Day with Prep Section**
```
1. User clicks "Monday" from meal plan
2. DayView loads and displays:

   MONDAY, January 13
   
   📋 Prep for Today (~25 minutes)
   ├─ Chop 2 onions, 1 bell pepper (10 min) → for lunch & dinner
   ├─ Marinate chicken (5 min) → for dinner
   └─ Cook 2 cups rice (10 min) → for lunch
   
   🌅 Breakfast: Oatmeal with Berries
   [🥗 ■■■■□] [⏳ ■■■□□] [⚖️ ■■■■□] [❤️ ■■■■□]
   
   🌞 Lunch: Chicken Stir Fry
   [🥗 ■■■■■] [⏳ ■■■□□] [⚖️ ■■■■□] [❤️ ■■■■■]
   
   🌙 Dinner: Mediterranean Bowl
   [🥗 ■■■■■] [⏳ ■■■■□] [⚖️ ■■■■□] [❤️ ■■■■■]

3. User sees prep needs first, then meals with health scores
```

### **FLOW D: Recipe Variation Creation**
```
1. User views "Spaghetti Bolognese" recipe detail
2. Clicks "Create Variation" button
3. RecipeEditPage opens with pre-filled data
4. User modifies: Replaces beef with lentils
5. Adds variation note: "Vegetarian version"
6. Saves as "Spaghetti Bolognese (Vegetarian)"
7. System creates:
   - New child recipe with unique ID
   - Links: parent ← → child
8. Original recipe now shows "Variations (1)" section
9. Child recipe shows "Based on: Spaghetti Bolognese" at top
10. Diet Compass scores recalculated (vegetarian version likely scores higher)
```

### **FLOW E: Multi-Profile Household Generation**
```
Given:
- Mom: Keto diet profile
- Dad: Vegan diet profile
- Kids: Kid-Friendly profile

Tuesday Dinner (all three eating):
- AI analyzes: Keto + Vegan = fundamental conflict
- Generates 2 recipes:
  - Recipe 1: Salmon with Asparagus (Keto) → for Mom
  - Recipe 2: Tofu Buddha Bowl (Vegan) → for Dad
- Kids can eat either (Kid-Friendly allows both)
- Display shows both recipes separately with names
- Shopping list includes ingredients for BOTH recipes
```

## Migration & Backward Compatibility

### **Data Migration (Slice 4 → Slice 5)**

**Script:** `src/migrations/migrateToSlice5.js`

**Steps:**
1. **Add mealPrepSettings to BaseSpecification**
   - Default: All meals = 'medium', batchPrepDays = [6] (Saturday)

2. **Add dietProfile to each Eater**
   - Default: null (unassigned)
   - personalPreferences = "" (empty)
   - excludeIngredients = []

3. **Enhance existing Recipe objects**
   - Add parentRecipeId = null
   - Add childRecipeIds = []
   - Add variationNote = null
   - Calculate Diet Compass scores for existing recipes
   - Add comprehensive tags
   - Add nutrition data (calculate if missing)

4. **Create new localStorage keys**
   - vanessa_recipe_catalog (empty initially)
   - vanessa_ingredient_health (from bundled data)
   - vanessa_diet_profiles (from bundled data)

5. **Update schema version**
   - BaseSpecification._schemaVersion = 2
   - Recipe._schemaVersion = 2 (if we add this)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Existing recipes work without scores (scores = null)
- Existing meal plans display without prep section
- No data loss
- Gradual enhancement as features are used

## Estimated Scope

### **Complexity Assessment:**
**Slice 5 is the LARGEST slice yet** — encompasses 6 major subsystems working together.

**Estimated Tasks:** 15-20 tasks  
**Estimated Subtasks:** 50-70 subtasks  
**Estimated Timeline:** 6-8 weeks  
**Estimated Lines of Code:** 5,000-7,000 lines

**Breakdown:**
1. Spoonacular extraction: 1-2 weeks (script + API + storage)
2. Diet Compass scoring: 1-2 weeks (engine + display + testing)
3. Diet profiles: 1 week (data + UI + generation integration)
4. Prep planning: 1-2 weeks (settings + generation + display)
5. Parent-child recipes: 1 week (schema + UI + workflow)
6. Integration & testing: 1-2 weeks (gluing it all together)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **Medium Risk:** Large scope, many interdependencies
- **High Value:** Transforms app from basic generator to health intelligence system
- **Recommendation:** Build incrementally, test each subsystem independently

## MEAL PREP OPTIMIZATION SYSTEM

### Overview
The meal prep system allows users to optimize their weekly cooking schedule by identifying batch-cooking opportunities, make-ahead meals, and prep day activities. This reduces daily cooking time while maintaining meal variety and freshness.

### User Meal Prep Strategies

Users can select their preferred meal prep style in Settings:

1. **Fresh Only** (Default)
   - Prepare each meal from raw ingredients before eating
   - Minimal advance preparation
   - Maximum freshness
   - Suitable for: Users with time each day, prefer fresh cooking

2. **Batch Cooking**
   - Dedicate 1-2 days per week to bulk meal preparation
   - Cook large quantities, portion, and store
   - Minimal daily cooking (mostly reheating/assembly)
   - Suitable for: Busy weekdays, prefer efficiency over daily cooking

3. **Hybrid** (Recommended)
   - Strategic mix of fresh and make-ahead
   - Prep components on designated days (e.g., Saturday)
   - Quick assembly on busy days, fresh cooking on lighter days
   - Suitable for: Most users, balanced approach

### Recipe Metadata for Prep Planning

**Enhanced Recipe Schema:**
```javascript
{
  recipeId: 'recipe_[uuid]',
  name: string,
  ingredients: [...],
  instructions: string,
  prepTime: number,
  cookTime: number,
  servings: number,
  
  // NEW: Meal prep fields
  prepStrategy: {
    type: 'fresh-only' | 'make-ahead' | 'batch-friendly' | 'components',
    storageTime: number,        // Days recipe keeps well (0-7)
    reheatTime: number,         // Minutes to reheat (if applicable)
    prepAheadInstructions: string,  // Special instructions for advance prep
    components: [               // For 'components' type
      {
        name: 'cooked chicken',
        prepTime: 20,
        storageTime: 3,
        usedIn: ['meal1', 'meal2']  // Which meals use this component
      }
    ]
  },
  
  complexity: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex',  // Influences prep day scheduling

### AI Prompt Enhancement for Meal Prep

**Generation System Prompt Update:**
```
You are Vanessa, an expert meal planning assistant. Generate a complete 7-day meal plan
optimized for the user's meal prep strategy.

USER MEAL PREP PREFERENCES:
- Strategy: {strategy} (fresh-only | batch-cooking | hybrid)
- Prep Days: {prepDays} (e.g., Saturday)
- Busy Days: {busyDays} (e.g., Mon-Fri)
- Light Days: {lightDays} (e.g., weekends)
- Max Prep Day Time: {maxPrepTime} minutes
- Batch Cooking Enabled: {batchCookingEnabled}
- Make-Ahead Enabled: {makeAheadMealsEnabled}

MEAL PREP OPTIMIZATION RULES:

1. **For "fresh-only" strategy:**
   - All meals should be quick-cooking (< 30 min prep+cook)
   - Use simple recipes with minimal prep
   - No advance preparation required
   - Focus on fresh ingredients

2. **For "batch-cooking" strategy:**
   - Prioritize recipes that scale well and store well
   - Identify components that can be batch-cooked (proteins, grains, sauces)
   - Schedule complex recipes on prep day
   - Quick assembly meals on busy days (< 15 min)
   - Ensure all batch-cooked items used within safe storage time

3. **For "hybrid" strategy (RECOMMENDED):**
   - Balance of fresh and make-ahead
   - Batch-cook 2-3 key components on prep day (e.g., protein, grains, chopped vegetables)
   - Use prepped components in multiple meals throughout week
   - Fresh, simple meals on light days
   - Quick assembly meals on busy days
   - 1-2 fully make-ahead meals (e.g., casseroles, lasagna)

COMPONENT REUSE STRATEGY:
- If batch-cooking chicken, use in 2-3 different recipes (stir-fry, salad, wrap)
- If chopping vegetables, use across multiple days
- If making sauce/dressing, portion for multiple meals
- Ensure variety despite component reuse (different cuisines, flavor profiles)

PREP DAY SCHEDULE:
- Total prep time should not exceed {maxPrepTime} minutes
- Organize tasks by type (proteins → vegetables → assembly)
- Provide clear storage instructions
- Indicate which days/meals use each prepped component

BUSY DAY MEALS:
- Must be < 20 minutes total time on busy days
- Use prepped components for quick assembly
- Or use make-ahead meals that just need reheating
- Simple cooking methods (stir-fry, salad, sandwich, reheated casserole)

LIGHT DAY MEALS:
- Can be more complex, longer cooking time (30-60 min)
- Fresh cooking encouraged
- Opportunity for meal prep for upcoming week

STORAGE & SAFETY:
- Cooked proteins: 3-4 days refrigerated
- Chopped vegetables: 3-5 days refrigerated
- Cooked grains/pasta: 4-5 days refrigerated
- Fully prepared meals: 3-4 days refrigerated
- Soups/stews: 4-5 days refrigerated
- Indicate if recipe is freezer-friendly (2-3 months)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each recipe, include:
```json
{
  "name": "Recipe Name",
  "ingredients": [...],
  "instructions": "...",
  "prepTime": 15,
  "cookTime": 25,
  "servings": 4,
  "prepStrategy": {
    "type": "batch-friendly",  // or "make-ahead", "fresh-only", "components"
    "storageTime": 3,          // days
    "reheatTime": 5,           // minutes (if applicable)
    "prepAheadInstructions": "Cook chicken on Saturday, store in airtight container",
    "components": [            // if type is "components"
      {
        "name": "cooked chicken",
        "prepTime": 20,
        "storageTime": 3
      }
    ]
  },
  "complexity": "moderate",
  "tags": ["quick-assembly", "meal-prep", "batch-friendly"]
}
```

CRITICAL: Generate recipes that align with user's strategy and minimize daily cooking time
on busy days while maximizing variety and freshness.

## Tech Stack (Confirmed)

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS (ES6 modules), HTML5, Tailwind CSS (CDN)
- **Backend**: Vercel Edge Functions (serverless)
- **Database**: 
  - **Slices 1-3**: localStorage (5MB, ~20-30 weeks capacity)
  - **Slice 4+**: Firebase Firestore (unlimited, multi-device sync)
- **AI**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (via Anthropic API)
- **Authentication**: None (Slices 1-3), Firebase Auth (Slice 4+)
- **Hosting**: Vercel (static site + serverless functions)
- **Build**: None (no build step, direct ES modules)

---

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No build step** - Static site, direct ES modules
2. **Streaming responses** - SSE for chat, better UX
3. **Mobile-first** - Chat must work well on phones
4. **Offline viewing** - Saved data viewable offline
5. **Privacy** - API keys server-side only

## Questions to Answer After Each Slice

### After Slice 1:
- What was awkward in the implementation?
- What assumptions were wrong?
- What patterns should be standardized?
- Is the data shape right for Slice 2?

### After Slice 2:
- Is the generation flow smooth?
- Is the data model working?
- What needs refactoring before expanding?

### After Slice 3:
- Is the full data model stable?
- What UI patterns work best?
- Ready for polish phase?

## Project-Specific Patterns (Learned from Slices 1, 2 & 3)

### Component Architecture
```javascript
export class ComponentName {
  constructor() {
    // Initialize state
  }
  
  // Optional lifecycle hooks
  beforeRender(state) {
    // Called before render
  }
  
  render(state) {
    // Return HTMLElement or string
    const container = document.createElement('div');
    // Build UI...
    return container;
  }
  
  afterRender(state) {
    // Called after render (good for async operations)
  }
  
  beforeUnload() {
    // Cleanup before component unmounts
  }
  
  destroy() {
    // Final cleanup
  }
}
```

### Storage Pattern
```javascript
// Always return data or sensible default (never throw)
export function loadData() {
  try {
    const saved = localStorage.getItem(KEY);
    if (saved) {
      const parsed = JSON.parse(saved);
      return Array.isArray(parsed) ? parsed : [];
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error loading data:', error);
  }
  return []; // Always return default
}

// Always return result object
export function saveData(data) {
  if (!Array.isArray(data)) {
    return { success: false, error: 'INVALID_TYPE' };
  }
  return safeSave(KEY, data);
}
```

### SSE Streaming Pattern
```javascript
// Server-side: Send SSE messages
function sendSSE(writer, encoder, data) {
  const message = `data: ${JSON.stringify(data)}\n\n`;
  writer.write(encoder.encode(message));
}

// Client-side: Process SSE stream
async processStream(response) {
  const reader = response.body.getReader();
  const decoder = new TextDecoder();
  let buffer = '';
  
  while (true) {
    const { value, done } = await reader.read();
    if (done) break;
    
    buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
    const lines = buffer.split('\n');
    buffer = lines.pop() || '';
    
    for (const line of lines) {
      if (!line.trim() || !line.startsWith('data: ')) continue;
      const data = JSON.parse(line.substring(6));
      // Handle data.type: 'progress', 'complete', 'error'
    }
  }
}
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Files**: Components use `PascalCase.js`, utilities use `camelCase.js`, APIs use `kebab-case.js`
- **localStorage Keys**: Standardize on `vanessa_` prefix (Slice 3)
- **IDs**: `recipe_[uuid]`, `meal_[uuid]`, `eater_[uuid]`, `plan_YYYYMMDD`

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Gradients**: Primary (`from-blue-400 to-indigo-400`), Success (`from-emerald-400 to-teal-400`)
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first, use `md:` breakpoint (768px)
- **Loading States**: Disable button + spinner + loading text
