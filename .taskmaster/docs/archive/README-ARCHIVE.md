## Why Archived?

These files were archived as part of a documentation consolidation effort to:
1. **Reduce PRD size** from 140KB → 17KB (88% reduction)
2. **Focus on current work** (Slice 5+) rather than historical context
3. **Preserve all information** while improving accessibility
4. **Eliminate duplication** between multiple PRD versions

Nothing was deleted—everything is preserved here for historical reference.

**Note:** If you need to reference completed slice details, these files remain accurate as-of their completion dates.
