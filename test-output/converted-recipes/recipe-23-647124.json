  "instructions": "<ol><li>Mise en place (put things in place).</li><li>Combine the flour, yeast, sugar, and water in a large bowl with a wooden spoon. Add more flour if it sticks to the sides and resembles more like a batter than dough.</li><li>All-Purpose Flour will give you more of a chewier crust, while Bread Flour will be crispier.</li><li>Once it comes together and isn't as sticky, scrape it out onto a well floured surface and sprinkle the salt on top.</li><li>Kneed the salt into the dough, adding flour as necessary.</li><li>Knead for 10 minutes, check if the dough is ready by slightly indenting the top of the dough, if it springs back you're good.</li><li>Tuck the ends underneath to stretch out the top and make a large ball, then put it in a well greased bowl rubbed with olive oil to proof.</li><li>Wrap it with cling film.</li><li>Place your cling wrap wrapped bowl inside the Microwave, and let it proof for an hour or until it has doubled in size.</li><li>Don't turn the microwave on, just let it sit in there.</li><li>While your dough is proofing you can prepare the pesto.</li><li>Soak almonds in water for fifteen minutes.</li><li>Wash and dry basil leaves.</li><li>Grate cheese. (extra for pizza too)</li><li>In a food processor we're going to put our basil, the cheese, soaked almonds, little salt and pepper, and 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil.</li><li>Process it on and off for thirty seconds.</li><li>Then drizzle in the rest of the olive oil while the food processor is on. This makes sure you get the optimal consistency for your likings.</li><li>When it's made fresh the oil tends to separate from the other ingredients. I suggest serving this after it's been in the refrigerator for an hour because the pesto rests and stays together better.</li><li>When the dough has doubled plop it onto a lightly dusted countertop and move it around so the entire dough gets covered.</li><li>Divide it into thirds.</li><li>Preheat the oven to 500F and place a baking stone on the middle rack. (you can also use an overturned cookie sheet)</li><li>NOTE: The baking stone/cookie sheet has to be larger than the size of the pizza you are making, otherwise it will hang over the edges and burn onto the oven rack.</li><li>Coat one ball of dough with flour and place it on a well-floured surface. Using your fingertips, gently flatten the dough into an 8-inch disk, leaving an inch or so of outer edge thicker than the center.</li><li>Using your hands, gently stretch it into a 10-12 inch round, working along the edges and giving the dough quarter turns as you stretch it.</li><li>Transfer the dough onto a pizza peel coated with flour or semolina, cornmeal is fine as well.</li><li>Top with a thin layer of the pesto.</li><li>Mandolin thin slices of potato and arrange them on the pizza. I don't prepare the potato ahead of time because sometimes it will oxidize and turn red and it makes for an ugly pizza.</li><li>Slide the pizza onto the stone and bake it for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is brown and the cheese as melty and shimmering.</li><li>Wait a little to slice and serve. Serve it hot.</li><li>I feel obliged to remind you about the other two balls of dough, but once you devour the first one I guarantee you'll be searching for the others. And as always,</li><li>Chow!</li></ol>",
