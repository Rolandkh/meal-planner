## 11. Kid-Friendly

### Overview
A child-focused eating pattern designed for young children (ages 2-6), emphasizing nutrient-dense foods presented in appealing, familiar ways. Balances nutritional needs with the reality of picky eating, food neophobia (fear of new foods), and developing palates. Prioritizes adequate growth, brain development, and establishing healthy eating habits.

### Key Principles
- Offer variety without pressure—children decide how much to eat
- Familiar foods alongside new ones (the "food bridge" approach)
- Small portions appropriate for little stomachs
- Regular meal and snack times (children need to eat every 2-3 hours)
- Make food visually appealing and fun
- Repeated exposure to new foods (may take 10-15 tries)
- Model healthy eating—children learn by watching
- Avoid using food as reward or punishment

### Foods to Emphasize
- **Proteins:** Chicken (especially nuggets, strips), eggs, mild fish (cod, barramundi), cheese, yogurt, mild beans
- **Carbohydrates:** Pasta (all shapes), rice, bread, crackers, oats, pancakes, toast
- **Fruits:** Bananas, apples, berries, grapes (halved), mandarin segments, watermelon, mango
- **Vegetables:** Carrots (raw sticks or cooked), cucumber, corn, peas, cherry tomatoes (halved), sweet potato
- **Dairy:** Milk, cheese (cubed or sliced), yogurt (plain or low-sugar), cottage cheese
- **Healthy Snacks:** Fruit, cheese and crackers, vegetable sticks with hummus, plain popcorn (age 4+)
- **Dips:** Hummus, yogurt-based dips, mild guacamole (encourages vegetable eating)

### Common Kid-Friendly Meals
- Pasta with mild sauce (butter, cheese, simple tomato)
- Chicken strips or nuggets (homemade preferred)
- Fish fingers (baked)
- Cheese quesadillas
- Scrambled eggs on toast
- Mild fried rice with vegetables
- Pizza (homemade with vegetable toppings)
- Soup (blended smooth for texture-sensitive children)
- Sandwiches (simple fillings)
- Pancakes or pikelets with fruit

### Foods to Approach Carefully
- Strong flavours (garlic, onion, spicy foods)—introduce gradually
- Mixed textures (can be off-putting for some children)
- Bitter vegetables (brussels sprouts, broccoli)—pair with familiar foods
- New proteins—introduce alongside accepted foods
- Whole nuts (choking hazard under age 5—use nut butters instead)
- Honey (avoid under age 1)
- Raw vegetables (some children prefer cooked)

### Foods to Avoid/Limit
- Added sugars and sugary drinks
- Highly processed foods
- Excessive salt
- Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes, whole nuts (choking hazards—cut appropriately)
- Caffeine
- Unpasteurized products
- Large fish high in mercury (shark, swordfish)
- Hard or sticky lollies (choking hazard)

### Nutritional Targets (Ages 3-5)
- **Calories:** 1,000-1,400 per day (varies by activity level)
- **Protein:** 13-19g daily
- **Calcium:** 500mg daily (for bone development)
- **Iron:** 10mg daily (critical for development)
- **Fiber:** 14-17g daily
- **Healthy Fats:** Important for brain development

### Meal Structure
- **Breakfast:** Essential—provides energy for morning activities
- **Morning Snack:** Small, nutritious
- **Lunch:** Main meal for many children
- **Afternoon Snack:** Bridges gap to dinner
- **Dinner:** Often smaller appetite by evening

### Portion Sizes (Rule of Thumb)
- 1 tablespoon per year of age for each food group
- A 4-year-old: approximately 4 tablespoons each of protein, grain, vegetable, fruit
- Let child's appetite guide—avoid forcing "clean plate"

### Strategies for Picky Eaters
- **Food bridges:** Connect accepted foods to new ones (likes chicken nuggets → try baked chicken)
- **Involvement:** Let children help prepare food
- **Presentation:** Fun shapes, colourful plates, food art
- **No short-order cooking:** Offer the family meal with at least one accepted food
- **Neutral response:** Don't celebrate eating or stress over refusal
- **Repeated exposure:** Offer rejected foods again after a few days
- **Dips and sauces:** Can make vegetables more appealing
- **Role modelling:** Eat the same foods together

### Special Considerations
- Growth spurts cause appetite fluctuations—this is normal
- Texture sensitivities are common and often outgrown
- Food jags (wanting same food repeatedly) are normal and temporary
- Consult pediatrician if concerned about growth or nutrition
- Vitamin D supplementation often recommended (especially in low-sunlight areas)
- Iron-rich foods important (often lacking in young children's diets)
- Patience is key—food preferences develop over years, not days
- Family meals together support healthy eating habits

### Adapting Adult Meals for Children
- Set aside child's portion before adding strong spices
- Cut foods into appropriate sizes
- Serve components separately (many children dislike mixed foods)
- Offer familiar sides alongside new main dishes
- Use milder versions of sauces
- Present vegetables in preferred form (raw vs cooked)
