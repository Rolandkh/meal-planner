# Diet Compass: Functional Summary for Meal Planning App

## Overview

This document extracts the actionable principles, food guidelines, and ranking criteria from "The Diet Compass" by Bas Kast - a synthesis of nutrition research spanning decades of scientific studies. The content is structured for use in a meal planning application with two primary components:

1. **Diet Profile** - A healthy eating framework
2. **Meal Ranking System** - Criteria to score meals across four metrics

---

# PART 1: DIET PROFILE FRAMEWORK

## Core Philosophy

### The 12 Foundational Principles

#### 1. Eat Real Food
- Consume unprocessed foods in their natural state
- Prioritize foods that don't need ingredient lists
- Focus on: vegetables, fruits, fish, and moderate amounts of meat
- Healthy processed exceptions: wholemeal products, yoghurt, cheese, olive oil, rapeseed oil, tea, coffee
- Rule: Foods with thousands of years of tradition behind them tend to be healthier processed options

#### 2. Make Plants Your Main Meal
- Vegetables should be the main course, not an accompaniment to meat
- All edible plants and mushrooms in natural state are among healthiest foods
- Preparation method (raw, boiled, steamed) doesn't significantly impact health benefits
- **Exceptions to "more is better"**: Potatoes and rice should be consumed in moderation
- Avoid: Refined sugar, white flour, fries, chips (vegan junk food)

#### 3. Fish Over Meat Hierarchy
**Healthiness ranking (best to worst):**
1. Oily fish and shellfish (best)
2. White meat (chicken, turkey) - ideally free-range
3. Red meat (beef, pork) - occasional, unprocessed only
4. Processed meat (sausages, hotdogs) - avoid entirely

**Recommended consumption:**
- Fish: 1-2 times per week
- White meat: 1-2 times per month
- Red meat: 1-2 times per year (grass-fed, wild game)
- Processed meat: Never

#### 4. Dairy Guidelines
- **Yoghurt/Kefir**: Highly recommended daily - best dairy choice
- **Cheese**: Good choice (fermented = beneficial)
- **Milk**: Limit to 1-2 glasses per day for adults
- Key insight: Fermentation matters more than fat content

#### 5. Sugar Minimization
- Reduce added sugar to minimum (not necessarily zero)
- Avoid industrial trans fats completely
- Avoid: Industrial snacks (chips, cookies, bakery items)
- Small amounts of sugar in otherwise nutritious foods (wheatgerm, red cabbage) are acceptable

#### 6. Embrace Healthy Fats
- Fat does not inherently make you fat
- Healthy fats are especially beneficial for obese individuals (insulin resistance)
- **Best fat sources:**
  - Nuts (all types, 2 handfuls daily)
  - Oily fish (salmon, herring)
  - Seeds (chia, flax/linseed, sunflower, pumpkin)
  - Avocados
  - Olive oil (extra virgin)
  - Rapeseed oil
  - Cheese
- Butter: Acceptable in moderation

## The Protein-Leverage Effect

### Core Principle
Humans have an innate drive to consume adequate protein. We continue eating until protein needs are met, regardless of total calories consumed.

### Implications for Meal Planning

**Problem:** Modern processed foods are protein-diluted
- Protein in natural foods: ~28% of calories (average)
- Protein in processed foods: ~9.5% of calories (average)

**Protein content by food type (% of calories from protein):**
| Food Category | Protein % |
|---------------|-----------|
| Fish and seafood | 68.3% |
| Meat (unprocessed) | 52.5% |
| Eggs | 36.6% |
| Milk and yoghurt | 28.4% |
| Pulses (beans, lentils) | 25.6% |
| Vegetables (broccoli) | 24.9% |
| Processed meat products | 31.7% |
| Ready-made pizza | 16.6% |
| Bread | 13.6% |
| Fries, potato chips | 5.1% |
| Ready desserts | 2.7% |

### Optimal Protein Sources Hierarchy

**Best (plants and fish):**
1. Legumes (lentils, beans, chickpeas)
2. Fish and shellfish
3. Nuts and seeds
4. Mushrooms
5. Vegetables (broccoli, spinach, asparagus)
6. Yoghurt

**Acceptable:**
- Poultry (chicken, turkey)
- Eggs

**Limit or Avoid:**
- Red meat
- Processed meat products
- Fried fish
- Pangasius

---

## Age-Specific Recommendations

### Ages 50-65 (Middle Age)
- **Reduce animal protein** (especially red meat)
- High animal protein intake associated with:
  - 74% increased mortality risk
  - 4x increased cancer risk
- mTOR activation from excess protein accelerates aging
- **Preferred proteins:** Plant sources, fish, yoghurt

### Ages 65+
- **Increase protein intake** to prevent muscle loss (sarcopenia)
- Higher protein becomes protective
- Focus on: Fish, yoghurt, legumes, eggs

### All Ages
- Plant proteins associated with **reduced** mortality risk
- Fermented dairy (yoghurt) beneficial at all ages
- Fish consumption beneficial at all ages

---

## The Mediterranean Diet Template

### Composition
- **Carbohydrates:** ~40% of calories
- **Fats:** ~40% of calories (primarily olive oil)
- **Protein:** ~15-20% of calories

### Daily Components
- Abundant vegetables (local, seasonal)
- Olive oil (generous, extra virgin)
- Whole grains
- Nuts and seeds
- Fruit (typically as dessert)
- Wine with meals (moderate)

### Weekly Components
- Fish: Several times per week
- Eggs: Up to 7
- Poultry: Occasional
- Fermented dairy: Regular

### Monthly Components
- Red meat: Few times only
- Sweets: Rare

---

## Timing and Fasting

### Time-Restricted Eating
- Eat only during limited window (e.g., 8am-8pm = "8 til 8 rule")
- Smaller window = greater effect
- No eating at night
- Consume most calories in first half of day
- Stop eating 2-4 hours before bed

### Skip Breakfast If Not Hungry
- Listen to body's signals
- Extends overnight fast naturally
- No obligation to eat breakfast

---

## Anti-Inflammatory Foods

### Key Principle
Chronic inflammation drives aging and disease. Anti-inflammatory foods protect health.

### Anti-Inflammatory Foods
| Category | Specific Foods |
|----------|----------------|
| Omega-3 sources | Oily fish, walnuts, chia seeds, flaxseeds |
| Spices | Turmeric (curcumin), ginger |
| Oils | Olive oil (extra virgin) |
| Fermented | Yoghurt, kefir |
| Beverages | Green tea, coffee |
| Vegetables | All, especially leafy greens |
| Fruits | Berries especially |

### Pro-Inflammatory Foods (Avoid)
- Processed meats
- Refined sugars
- Trans fats
- Excessive alcohol
- Ultra-processed foods

- Olive oil (extra virgin)
- Fasting/calorie restriction

**mTOR activators (accelerate aging when excessive):**
- High animal protein
- Excessive calories
- Refined sugars

#### IGF-1 Modulation
- Lower IGF-1 in middle age = slower aging
- Plant proteins don't spike IGF-1 like animal proteins

### Scoring Criteria

### Longevity-Associated Eating Patterns

**Pescetarian diet** = Highest longevity in Adventist studies
- Vegetarian base
- Fish 1-2 times weekly
- No other meat

**Calorie restriction** = Extended lifespan in all studied species
- Don't overeat
- Practice "hara hachi bu" (eat until 80% full)

---

## METRIC 3: WEIGHT LOSS SCORE

### Definition
Measures a food's impact on satiety, metabolic rate, and fat storage/burning.

### Key Mechanisms

#### Protein Leverage
- High protein = earlier satiety = fewer total calories
- Protein has "anorexic" effect on appetite

#### Insulin Response
- Low insulin = easier fat burning
- High insulin = fat storage mode
- Some people are "carbohydrate intolerant"

#### Thermic Effect
- Protein: ~25-30% of calories burned in digestion
- Carbs: ~6-8% of calories burned in digestion
- Fat: ~2-3% of calories burned in digestion

### Scoring Criteria

#### High Weight Loss Score (8-10)
**"Slimming foods" (Harvard study):**
- Yoghurt (TOP performer)
- Nuts
- Vegetables
- Whole grains
- Fruits

**High satiety, moderate calories:**
- Legumes
- Fish
- Eggs
- Poultry

**Key characteristics:**
- High protein percentage
- High fiber content
- Low glycemic index
- Contains healthy fats

#### Medium Weight Loss Score (5-7)
- Cheese
- Olive oil (high satiety despite calories)
- Whole grain bread
- Potatoes (boiled, not fried)
- Rice (brown preferred)

#### Low Weight Loss Score (1-4)
**"Fattening foods" (Harvard study):**
- Potato chips (worst)
- French fries
- Sugar-sweetened beverages
- Refined grains
- Processed meats
- White bread
- Sweets

### Weight Loss Formula

```
Weight Loss Score = 
  Protein Density (0-3) +
  Fiber Content (0-2) +
  Glycemic Impact Inverse (0-2) +
  Processing Level Inverse (0-2) +
  Satiety Factor (0-1)
```

### Special Considerations

#### Insulin Resistant Individuals
For people with insulin resistance/pre-diabetes:
- Prioritize low-carb foods
- Extra points for: fats, proteins, low-glycemic foods
- Penalty for: high-glycemic carbs, fruit juice, white starches

#### Foods That Paradoxically Aid Weight Loss
Despite high calorie density:
- Nuts (satiety, protein, healthy fats)
- Olive oil (satiety)
- Full-fat yoghurt (fermentation benefits)
- Avocados (fiber, healthy fats)

---

## METRIC 4: HEART HEALTH SCORE

### Definition
Measures impact on cardiovascular system including blood pressure, cholesterol, arterial health, and heart disease risk.

### Key Mechanisms

#### Cholesterol Impact
- LDL ("bad" cholesterol) - want lower
- HDL ("good" cholesterol) - want higher
- Particle size matters

#### Blood Pressure
- High sodium = higher blood pressure
- Potassium, magnesium = lower blood pressure
- Omega-3s = lower blood pressure

#### Arterial Health
- Inflammation = arterial damage
- Oxidation = arterial damage
- Antioxidants = protection

#### Proven Interventions
- Plant-based diets can REVERSE cardiovascular disease
- Arterial blockages have been shown to disappear on strict plant diets

### Scoring Criteria

#### High Heart Health Score (8-10)
**Proven cardioprotective foods:**

| Food | Heart Benefit |
|------|---------------|
| Oily fish | Omega-3, reduces fatal heart disease |
| Olive oil | Antioxidants, anti-inflammatory |
| Nuts | 30% reduction in cardiovascular disease |
| Legumes | Fiber, plant protein, potassium |

| Berries | Antioxidants, polyphenols |
| Leafy greens | Nitrates improve blood pressure |
| Whole grains | Fiber, B vitamins |
| Avocados | Potassium, healthy fats |
| Green tea | Catechins |

**Quantified benefits:**
- Two handfuls nuts/day = 30% reduced cardiovascular risk
- Fish once/week = reduced heart disease risk
- Olive oil as primary fat = Mediterranean diet benefits

#### Medium Heart Health Score (5-7)
- Poultry
- Eggs (up to 1/day)
- Cheese (fermented benefits vs. saturated fat)
- Wine (moderate amounts)
- Coffee
- Dark chocolate (high cocoa %)

#### Low Heart Health Score (1-4)
**Foods that harm heart health:**

| Food | Heart Risk |
|------|------------|
| Processed meats | Highest risk |
| Trans fats | Arterial damage |
| Excessive sugar | Inflammation, triglycerides |
| Deep fried foods | Oxidized fats |
| High sodium foods | Blood pressure |
| Excessive red meat | Saturated fat, inflammation |
| Soft drinks | Metabolic syndrome |

**Quantified risks:**
- 120g red meat daily = 29% increased mortality
- 60g processed meat daily = 22% increased mortality

### Heart Health Formula

```
Heart Health Score = 
  Omega-3 Content (0-2) +
  Fiber Content (0-2) +
  Antioxidant Level (0-2) +
  Sodium Level Inverse (0-1) +
  Saturated Fat Inverse (0-1) +

### Omega-3 to Omega-6 Ratio
- Modern diets have too much omega-6 (inflammatory)
- Need more omega-3 (anti-inflammatory)
- Best ratio: Closer to 1:1 or 1:4
- Current Western diet: Often 1:15 to 1:20

**To improve ratio:**
- Eat more fatty fish
- Use olive oil instead of seed oils
- Add walnuts, flax, chia
- Reduce processed foods

## MEAL PLANNING ALGORITHM SUGGESTIONS

### Scoring Formula Weights

For a balanced health approach, consider these metric weights:
- Nutrient Density: 25%
- Longevity: 25%
- Weight Loss: 25%  
- Heart Health: 25%

For weight loss focus:
- Nutrient Density: 20%
- Longevity: 15%
- Weight Loss: 45%
- Heart Health: 20%

For heart health focus:
- Nutrient Density: 20%
- Longevity: 20%
- Weight Loss: 15%
- Heart Health: 45%

For longevity focus:
- Nutrient Density: 25%
- Longevity: 40%
- Weight Loss: 15%
- Heart Health: 20%

### Ingredient Combination Bonuses

Synergistic combinations that should receive bonus points:
- Olive oil + vegetables (increases nutrient absorption)
- Vitamin C foods + iron-rich foods (increases iron absorption)
- Turmeric + black pepper (increases curcumin absorption 2000%)
- Fat + fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- Fermented dairy + fruit (yoghurt parfait)
- Fish + vegetables (Mediterranean pattern)
- Legumes + whole grains (complete protein)

### Ingredient Combination Penalties

Combinations to penalize:
- Meat + refined carbohydrates (burger with white bun)
- Fat + sugar together (desserts, pastries)
- Processed meat + anything (always penalize)
- Fried + starchy (fish and chips)
