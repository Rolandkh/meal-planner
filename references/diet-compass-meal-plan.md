# Diet Compass Meal Plan - Master Guide
**Created: December 2025 | Updated: January 2026**

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### The Science Behind This Plan

This meal plan is built on four key scientific mechanisms from The Diet Compass:

1. **Protein-Leverage Effect**: We eat until protein needs are met (~15% of calories). High-quality protein sources = earlier satiety = fewer total calories consumed.

2. **mTOR Modulation**: Excess animal protein activates mTOR, accelerating aging. Plant proteins and certain foods (coffee, olive oil, green tea) inhibit mTOR.

3. **Anti-Inflammatory Balance**: Chronic inflammation drives aging and disease. Omega-3s, fermented foods, and plant compounds reduce inflammation.

4. **Gut Microbiome Support**: Fermented foods and fiber feed beneficial bacteria, improving metabolism, immunity, and weight regulation.

### Diet Compass Food Classifications

**TIER 1 - HIGHLY PROTECTIVE** (Daily Foundation):
- **Vegetables** (especially leafy greens, cruciferous) - Top priority
- **Legumes** (lentils, chickpeas, beans) - Best carb/protein source
- **Nuts and seeds** (walnuts, almonds, chia, flax) - 2 handfuls daily
- **Oily fish** (salmon, sardines, mackerel, herring) - Best animal protein
- **Fermented dairy** (yoghurt, kefir) - Anti-aging, weight management
- **Olive oil** (extra virgin) - Primary fat source
- **Berries** (blueberries, strawberries, raspberries)
- **Whole grains** (oats, quinoa, bulgur)

**TIER 2 - BENEFICIAL** (Include Regularly):
- Eggs (up to 7/week)
- Poultry (free-range chicken, turkey)
- Other fruits
- Cheese (fermented = better)
- Green tea, coffee
- Dark chocolate (70%+ cacao)

**TIER 3 - LIMIT** (Occasional Only):
- Red meat (grass-fed, few times yearly)
- Milk (1-2 glasses max/day for adults)
- White rice, potatoes
- Butter (small amounts)

**TIER 4 - AVOID** (Eliminate):
- Processed meats (sausages, bacon, ham, hot dogs)
- Ultra-processed foods
- Added sugars and soft drinks
- Refined carbohydrates (white bread, pastries)
- Deep-fried foods
- Industrial trans fats

### Key Dietary Principles
- **Real food rule**: "Eat foods your great-grandmother would recognize"
- **Plants as main course**: Vegetables are the meal, protein is the complement
- **Protein moderation**: ~15% of calories (60-75g daily), prioritize plant and fish sources
- **Quality fats**: Olive oil, nuts, seeds, oily fish (omega-3 focus)
- **Slow carbohydrates only**: Legumes, whole grains, vegetables (avoid fast carbs)
- **Fermentation priority**: Yoghurt > milk; sauerkraut, kimchi, kefir
- **Time-restricted eating**: 10-14 hour eating window
- **Metabolic individuality**: Adjust carbs based on personal response

## MODIFIED PROTEIN BAR RECIPE
**Less Sticky Version with Dark Chocolate Coating**

### Yield
- 12 bars (approximately 70g each)
- Storage: 3-4 weeks refrigerated, 2 months frozen

### Ingredients

**Dry Ingredients:**
- 200g rolled oats
- 100g walnuts (roughly chopped)
- 80g plant-based protein powder
- 30g cacao powder
- 15g maca powder
- 50g chia seeds (increased from 30g)
- 30g oat flour (grind rolled oats to powder)
- 100g dried blueberries (or freeze-dried)
- 10g Lion's Mane mushroom powder
- 5g Reishi mushroom powder
- 5g turmeric powder
- 20g ground flaxseed
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of black pepper (activates turmeric)

**Wet Ingredients:**
- 260g almond butter (or any nut butter)
- 100ml maple syrup (reduced from 180ml)
- 2 ripe bananas (approximately 200g, mashed)
- 60ml plant milk
- 5g fresh ginger (finely grated)

**Dark Chocolate Layers:**
- 200-250g dark chocolate (70-85% cacao)
- 30-40g coconut oil (makes chocolate easier to cut)

### Method - Simplified Slice Method

1. **Prepare pan:** Line a 20×20cm baking tin with parchment paper

2. **Bottom chocolate layer:** 
   - Melt 100-125g dark chocolate + 15-20g coconut oil together (double boiler or microwave in 30-second intervals)
   - Pour into lined pan and spread evenly
   - Refrigerate 10 minutes until set

3. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients (oats, walnuts, protein powder, cacao, maca, chia, oat flour, dried blueberries, mushroom powders, turmeric, flaxseed, salt, black pepper). Mix thoroughly.

4. **Prepare wet mixture:** In a small saucepan, gently warm the almond butter, maple syrup, and plant milk together over low heat until smooth and combined. Remove from heat. Stir in mashed bananas and grated ginger.

5. **Combine:** Pour wet mixture into dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined and sticky. The mixture should hold together when pressed.

6. **Add bar mixture to pan:** Spread bar mixture over the set chocolate layer. Press down VERY FIRMLY with your hands or the back of a measuring cup. The more you compress it, the better it holds together. Make surface as even as possible.

7. **First refrigeration:** Refrigerate for 2-3 hours (or until firm).

8. **Top chocolate layer:** 
   - Melt remaining 100-125g dark chocolate + 15-20g coconut oil together
   - Pour over the top of the bar mixture and spread evenly
   - Refrigerate 30 minutes until chocolate is completely set

9. **Cut into slices:** Remove from tin using parchment paper. Use a large sharp knife to cut into 12 equal bars. **Tip:** Warm knife under hot water and dry it between cuts for cleanest slices.

10. **Wrap and store:** Wrap each bar individually in parchment paper. Store in airtight container in refrigerator (or freeze half the batch).

**Time saved:** This method is 20-30 minutes faster than dipping individual bars!

## WEEKLY FASTING PROTOCOL

### Thursday (Fast Begins)
- **8:00 AM:** Breakfast (1 protein bar)
- **12:00 PM:** Lunch (early - choose high-satiety option like Hummus Power Bowl or Buddha Bowl)
- **Last bite by 12:30 PM**
- **NO DINNER**
- **Fasting period begins**

### During the 24-Hour Fast (Thursday 12:30 PM - Friday 1:00 PM)
**ALLOWED:**
- Water (drink plenty - aim for 2-3L)
- Black coffee (no milk, no sugar)
- Herbal tea (no sweetener)
- Green tea

**NOT ALLOWED:**
- Any food
- Milk or cream in coffee
- Sweeteners of any kind
- Bone broth or soup
- Diet drinks or zero-calorie drinks with artificial sweeteners

**Tips for Success:**
- Stay busy on Thursday evening
- Go to bed earlier if possible
- Drink water when hungry
- Friday morning: have black coffee or herbal tea
- Light activity is fine (walking, gentle yoga)
- Avoid intense exercise during the fast

### Friday (Breaking the Fast)
- **8:00 AM:** Black coffee or herbal tea only (no breakfast)
- **1:00 PM:** Break fast with late lunch
  - 1 protein bar
  - Light salad with hummus
  - Take your time eating
  - Chew slowly
- **10-minute walk after lunch**
- **5:30 PM:** Light plant-based dinner
- **Resume normal schedule Saturday**

### The Science of Fasting (Diet Compass Evidence)

**Why fasting works (from the book):**

1. **Autophagy Activation**
   - mTOR is deactivated during fasting
   - Cells enter "cleanup mode" (autophagy)
   - Damaged proteins and organelles are recycled
   - Anti-aging effect at the cellular level

2. **Insulin Sensitivity Reset**
   - Fasting allows insulin levels to drop
   - Cells regain insulin sensitivity
   - Fat burning mode activated
   - Particularly beneficial for overweight individuals

3. **Growth Factor Reduction**
   - IGF-1 levels decrease during fasting
   - Reduced cell proliferation signals
   - Associated with longevity

4. **Time-Restricted Benefits**
   - Book recommends: Eat most calories earlier in day
   - Stop eating 2-4 hours before bed
   - Eating window: 8-12 hours optimal
   - Late-night eating disrupts circadian rhythm

**This plan implements:**
- 14-hour daily fast (8AM-6PM eating window)
- 24-hour weekly fast (Thursday lunch to Friday lunch)
- Most calories consumed at breakfast and lunch
- Light dinner, finished early

## BEVERAGE GUIDELINES

### The Science of Drinks (Diet Compass Hierarchy)

**Beverages are ranked by health impact:**

| Rank | Beverage | Key Benefits |
|------|----------|--------------|
| 1 | Water | Hydration, zero calories |
| 2 | Green tea | mTOR inhibitor, EGCG antioxidants |
| 3 | Coffee (black) | mTOR inhibitor, longevity benefits (3-4 cups OK) |
| 4 | Herbal tea | Anti-inflammatory, zero calories |
| 5 | Red wine (moderate) | With meals only, polyphenols |
| 6 | Milk | Adults limit 1-2 glasses/day |
| 7 | Fruit juice | Avoid - sugar without fiber |
| 8 | Soft drinks | Never - worst choice |

### ALLOWED ANYTIME (Fasting-Safe)
- Water (aim for 2-3L daily)
- Black coffee (no milk, no sugar) - **mTOR inhibitor**
- Green tea - **mTOR inhibitor, EGCG for longevity**
- Herbal tea (no sweetener)

### ALLOWED DURING EATING WINDOW ONLY (8 AM - 6 PM)
- Coffee with plant milk (small amount)
- Tea with plant milk (small amount)

### NOT ALLOWED
- Fruit juice (high sugar, no fiber - strips fruit's benefits)
- Soft drinks/soda (worst beverage choice)
- Energy drinks
- Alcohol (or very rarely, only during eating window, with food)
- Sweetened beverages of any kind
- Diet drinks with artificial sweeteners (may harm gut microbiome)

### Coffee/Tea Longevity Notes
- **Coffee:** 3-4 cups daily associated with reduced mortality (inhibits mTOR)
- **Green tea:** EGCG compound inhibits mTOR, supports longevity
- **Herbal teas:** Ginger (anti-inflammatory), turmeric (mTOR inhibitor), peppermint (digestive)
- **Avoid:** Adding sugar or sweeteners (negates benefits)

## TRACKING & ADJUSTMENT

### What to Track
- **Weight:** Weekly (same day, same time)
- **Energy levels:** Daily (1-10 scale)
- **Hunger levels:** Note if you're genuinely hungry between meals
- **Digestion:** How you feel after meals
- **Sleep quality:** Note any changes
- **24-hour fast:** How you feel during and after

### Signs You Need to Adjust

**If too hungry:**
- Add 50g more legumes to lunch options
- Increase vegetables at dinner to 300g
- Ensure you're drinking enough water

**If not losing weight (after 4 weeks):**
- Reduce portions slightly (10%)
- Ensure no snacking between meals
- Check chocolate coating portions (may be generous)

**If losing weight too quickly (>1kg/week):**
- Add 100 calories to lunch
- Add 1/2 avocado to more dinners

### Why This Plan Aligns with Diet Compass Research

**Protein Strategy (Matches book perfectly)**
- 15% of calories from protein (book recommends ~15%)
- Prioritizes fish > plant > poultry > occasional red meat
- Yoghurt as daily animal protein (anti-aging properties)
- Legumes at every lunch (best plant protein + slow carb)

**Fat Strategy (Mediterranean pattern)**
- Olive oil as primary fat (mTOR inhibition, antioxidants)
- Nuts daily (Harvard study: 30% reduced cardiovascular risk)
- Omega-3 from fish, chia, flax, walnuts (anti-inflammatory)
- No fear of healthy fats (supports insulin-resistant individuals)

**Carbohydrate Strategy (Slow carbs only)**
- Legumes as primary carb source (lowest glycemic, highest fiber)
- Whole grains in moderation (oats, quinoa, bulgur)
- No refined carbs or added sugars
- Above-ground vegetables prioritized

**Timing Strategy (Book-aligned fasting)**
- Daily eating window: 10 hours (book recommends 8-12)
- Stop eating 3-4 hours before bed (book: 2-4 hours)
- Weekly 24-hour fast (enhances autophagy)
- Most calories in first half of day

**Anti-Aging Compounds Daily**
- Turmeric + black pepper (2000% increased curcumin absorption)
- Ginger (anti-inflammatory)
- Coffee (mTOR inhibitor, longevity benefits)
- Olive oil (oleocanthal - mTOR inhibitor)
- Dark chocolate (polyphenols)
- Lion's Mane + Reishi (cognitive support, immune modulation)

## ADDITIONAL NOTES

### Understanding Your Metabolic Type
The Diet Compass emphasizes metabolic individuality. Signs you may be **carbohydrate intolerant**:
- Blood sugar spikes/crashes after carb-heavy meals
- Difficulty losing weight on low-fat diets
- Belly fat accumulation
- Family history of diabetes

**If carb intolerant:** Reduce or eliminate whole grains at lunch, increase healthy fats (avocado, olive oil, nuts). This plan's carb-free dinners already accommodate this.

**If carb tolerant:** Current plan is optimal. You can add sweet potato occasionally.

### Flexibility
- Lunch options can be rotated in any order
- Dinner options can be mixed and matched
- If you need to swap Thursday/Friday fast to another day, maintain the 24-hour structure

### Social Situations
- If dinner invitation on non-Thursday: shift eating window to 8 AM - 8 PM that day
- Choose fish or vegetable-based options when eating out
- Skip the bread basket, ask for extra vegetables
- Mediterranean restaurants are ideal (olive oil, fish, vegetables)

### Travel
- Protein bars travel perfectly (already wrapped)
- Pack bars for breakfast and lunch
- Find simple dinner options (salad with protein)
- Prioritize countries/regions with Mediterranean-style cuisine

### Recipe Variations
- All recipes can be seasoned to your taste
- Use any herbs and spices freely (turmeric + black pepper is synergistic)
- Adjust vegetables based on what's fresh/seasonal
- Cruciferous vegetables (broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage) are particularly protective

### Long-term Sustainability
- This plan is designed to be maintained indefinitely
- Not a "crash diet" but a sustainable lifestyle
- Adjust portions as you reach maintenance weight
- The 24-hour fast can be reduced to monthly if preferred once at goal weight
- The book's research shows: The best diet is one you can maintain for life

### What This Plan Is NOT
- **Not extreme low-carb:** Includes whole grains at lunch
- **Not high-protein:** Stays at ~15% (book's recommended range)
- **Not zero-fat:** Embraces healthy fats (olive oil, nuts, fish)
- **Not vegetarian:** Includes fish as optimal animal protein
- **Not restrictive:** Real food approach, not elimination diet

## QUICK REFERENCE SUMMARY

**THE DIET COMPASS APPROACH:**
> "Eat real food, mostly plants, not too much protein."

**MEAL STRUCTURE:**
- Breakfast: 1 protein bar (280-300 cal) - Omega-3, plant protein, adaptogens
- Lunch: 1 protein bar + complement (880-900 cal) - Legumes, whole grains, fermented dairy
- Dinner: Fish/plant protein + vegetables, no carbs (450-500 cal)

**GOLDEN RULES:**
1. Eating window: 8 AM - 6 PM only (mTOR inhibition overnight)
2. No snacking between meals (maintains insulin sensitivity)
3. No food after 6 PM (circadian alignment)
4. 10-minute walk after lunch (blood sugar regulation)
5. 24-hour fast Thursday lunch to Friday lunch (autophagy activation)
6. Fish 3-4x/week, red meat rarely (longevity pattern)
7. Yoghurt daily, fermented foods regularly (microbiome support)

**DAILY TARGETS:**
- Calories: 1,490-1,540 (except Friday ~1,200-1,300)
- Protein: 60-75g (~15% of calories)
