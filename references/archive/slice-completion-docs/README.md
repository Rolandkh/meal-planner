## Why These Files Were Archived

These files violated the project's documentation protocol which states:

**NEVER CREATE THESE:**
- ❌ Session logs: `SESSION-SUMMARY-*.md`
- ❌ Slice docs: `SLICE-*-COMPLETION.md`, `SLICE-*-BUILD-COMPLETE.md`
- ❌ Testing checklists: `*-TEST-REPORT.md`

**Instead, information should go in:**
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md for version history
- ✅ ARCHITECTURE.md for technical decisions
- ✅ FEATURES.md for feature status
- ✅ docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md for temporary session notes (auto-delete after 7 days)

---

## Historical Value

These files are preserved in this archive for:
- Historical reference
- Detailed implementation notes
- Session-specific context
- Statistics and metrics that don't belong in permanent docs

---

## Accessing Information

If you need information from these archived files:

1. **Check permanent docs first** - 95% of info is there
2. **Specific implementation details?** - Check this archive
3. **Session-specific context?** - Review the archived files

**Archive Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Compliance Status:** ✅ Full compliance with documentation protocol
