## MODIFIED PROTEIN BAR RECIPE
**Less Sticky Version with Dark Chocolate Coating**

### Yield
- 12 bars (approximately 70g each)
- Storage: 3-4 weeks refrigerated, 2 months frozen

### Ingredients

**Dry Ingredients:**
- 200g rolled oats
- 100g walnuts (roughly chopped)
- 80g plant-based protein powder
- 30g cacao powder
- 15g maca powder
- 50g chia seeds (increased from 30g)
- 30g oat flour (grind rolled oats to powder)
- 100g dried blueberries (or freeze-dried)
- 10g Lion's Mane mushroom powder
- 5g Reishi mushroom powder
- 5g turmeric powder
- 20g ground flaxseed
- Pinch of salt
- Pinch of black pepper (activates turmeric)

**Wet Ingredients:**
- 260g almond butter (or any nut butter)
- 100ml maple syrup (reduced from 180ml)
- 2 ripe bananas (approximately 200g, mashed)
- 60ml plant milk
- 5g fresh ginger (finely grated)

**Dark Chocolate Layers:**
- 200-250g dark chocolate (70-85% cacao)
- 30-40g coconut oil (makes chocolate easier to cut)

### Method - Simplified Slice Method

1. **Prepare pan:** Line a 20×20cm baking tin with parchment paper

2. **Bottom chocolate layer:** 
   - Melt 100-125g dark chocolate + 15-20g coconut oil together (double boiler or microwave in 30-second intervals)
   - Pour into lined pan and spread evenly
   - Refrigerate 10 minutes until set

3. **Mix dry ingredients:** In a large bowl, combine all dry ingredients (oats, walnuts, protein powder, cacao, maca, chia, oat flour, dried blueberries, mushroom powders, turmeric, flaxseed, salt, black pepper). Mix thoroughly.

4. **Prepare wet mixture:** In a small saucepan, gently warm the almond butter, maple syrup, and plant milk together over low heat until smooth and combined. Remove from heat. Stir in mashed bananas and grated ginger.

5. **Combine:** Pour wet mixture into dry ingredients. Mix thoroughly until everything is well combined and sticky. The mixture should hold together when pressed.

6. **Add bar mixture to pan:** Spread bar mixture over the set chocolate layer. Press down VERY FIRMLY with your hands or the back of a measuring cup. The more you compress it, the better it holds together. Make surface as even as possible.

7. **First refrigeration:** Refrigerate for 2-3 hours (or until firm).

8. **Top chocolate layer:** 
   - Melt remaining 100-125g dark chocolate + 15-20g coconut oil together
   - Pour over the top of the bar mixture and spread evenly
   - Refrigerate 30 minutes until chocolate is completely set

9. **Cut into slices:** Remove from tin using parchment paper. Use a large sharp knife to cut into 12 equal bars. **Tip:** Warm knife under hot water and dry it between cuts for cleanest slices.

10. **Wrap and store:** Wrap each bar individually in parchment paper. Store in airtight container in refrigerator (or freeze half the batch).

**Time saved:** This method is 20-30 minutes faster than dipping individual bars!
